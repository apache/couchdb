Apache CouchDB CHANGES
======================

Version 1.2.2
-------------

HTTP Interface:

 * Reset rewrite counter on new request, avoiding unnecessary request failures
   due to bogus rewrite limit reports.

Build System:

 * Fixed issue in couchdb script where stopped status returns before process
   exits.

Version 1.2.1
-------------

Security:

 * Fixed CVE-2012-5641: Apache CouchDB Information disclosure via unescaped
   backslashes in URLs on Windows
 * Fixed CVE-2012-5649: Apache CouchDB JSONP arbitrary code execution with Adobe
   Flash
 * Fixed CVE-2012-5650: Apache CouchDB DOM based Cross-Site Scripting via Futon
   UI

HTTP Interface:

 * No longer rewrites the X-CouchDB-Requested-Path during recursive
   calls to the rewriter.
 * Limit recursion depth in the URL rewriter. Defaults to a maximum
   of 100 invocations but is configurable.

Build System:

 * Fix couchdb start script.
 * Win: fix linker invocations.

Futon:

 * Disable buttons that aren't available for the logged-in user.

Replication:

 * Fix potential timeouts.

View System:

 * Change use of signals to avoid broken view groups.

Version 1.2.0
-------------

Authentication:

 * Fix use of OAuth with VHosts and URL rewriting.
 * OAuth secrets can now be stored in the users system database
   as an alternative to key value pairs in the .ini configuration.
   By default this is disabled (secrets are stored in the .ini)
   but can be enabled via the .ini configuration key `use_users_db`
   in the `couch_httpd_oauth` section.
 * Documents in the _users database are no longer publicly
   readable.
 * Confidential information in the _replication database is no
   longer publicly readable.
 * Password hashes are now calculated by CouchDB. Clients are no
   longer required to do this manually.
 * Cookies used for authentication can be made persistent by enabling
   the .ini configuration key `allow_persistent_cookies' in the
   `couch_httpd_auth` section.

Build System:

 * cURL is no longer required to build CouchDB as it is only
   used by the command line JS test runner. If cURL is available
   when building CouchJS you can enable the HTTP bindings by
   passing -H on the command line.
 * Temporarily made `make check` pass with R15B. A more thorough
   fix is in the works (COUCHDB-1424).
 * Fixed --with-js-include and --with-js-lib options.
 * Added --with-js-lib-name option.

HTTP Interface:

 * Added a native JSON parser.
 * The _active_tasks API now offers more granular fields. Each
   task type is now able to expose different properties.
 * Added built-in changes feed filter `_view`.
 * Fixes to the `_changes` feed heartbeat option which caused
   heartbeats to be missed when used with a filter. This caused
   timeouts of continuous pull replications with a filter.
 * Properly restart the SSL socket on configuration changes.

Replicator:

 * A new replicator implementation. It offers more performance and
   configuration options.
 * Passing non-string values to query_params is now a 400 bad
   request. This is to reduce the surprise that all parameters
   are converted to strings internally.
 * Added optional field `since_seq` to replication objects/documents.
   It allows to bootstrap a replication from a specific source sequence
   number.
 * Simpler replication cancellation. In addition to the current method,
   replications can now be canceled by specifying the replication ID
   instead of the original replication object/document.

Storage System:

 * Added optional database and view index file compression (using Google's
   snappy or zlib's deflate). This feature is enabled by default, but it
   can be disabled by adapting local.ini accordingly. The on-disk format
   is upgraded on compaction and new DB/view creation to support this.
 * Several performance improvements, most notably regarding database writes
   and view indexing.
 * Computation of the size of the latest MVCC snapshot data and all its
   supporting metadata, both for database and view index files. This
   information is exposed as the `data_size` attribute in the database and
   view group information URIs.
 * The size of the buffers used for database and view compaction is now
   configurable.
 * Added support for automatic database and view compaction. This feature
   is disabled by default, but it can be enabled via the .ini configuration.
 * Performance improvements for the built-in changes feed filters `_doc_ids`
   and `_design'.

View Server:

 * Add CoffeeScript (http://coffeescript.org/) as a first class view server
   language.
 * Fixed old index file descriptor leaks after a view cleanup.
 * The requested_path property keeps the pre-rewrite path even when no VHost
   configuration is matched.
 * Fixed incorrect reduce query results when using pagination parameters.
 * Made icu_driver work with Erlang R15B and later.
 * Avoid invalidating view indexes when running out of file descriptors
   (COUCHDB-1445).

OAuth:

 * Updated bundled erlang_oauth library to the latest version.

Futon:

 * The `Status` screen (active tasks) now displays two new task status
   fields: `Started on` and `Updated on`.
 * Futon remembers view code every time it is saved, allowing to save an
   edit that amounts to a revert.

Log System:

 * Log correct stacktrace in all cases.
 * Improvements to log messages for file-related errors.

Version 1.1.2

Version 0.8.1-incubating
------------------------

Database Core:

 * Fix for replication problems where the write queues can get backed up if the
   writes aren't happening fast enough to keep up with the reads. For a large
   replication, this can exhaust memory and crash, or slow down the machine
   dramatically. The fix keeps only one document in the write queue at a time.
 * Fix for databases sometimes incorrectly reporting that they contain 0
   documents after compaction.
 * CouchDB now uses ibrowse instead of inets for its internal HTTP client
   implementation. This means better replication stability.

HTTP Interface:

 * Fix for chunked responses where chunks were always being split into multiple
   TCP packets, which caused problems with the test suite under Safari, and in
   some other cases.
 * Fix for an invalid JSON response body being returned for some kinds of
   views. (COUCHDB-84)
 * Fix for connections not getting closed after rejecting a chunked request.
   (COUCHDB-55)
 * CouchDB can now be bound to IPv6 addresses.
 * The HTTP `Server` header now contains the versions of CouchDB and Erlang.

JavaScript View Server:

 * Sealing of documents has been disabled due to an incompatibility with
   SpiderMonkey 1.9.
 * Improve error handling for undefined values emitted by map functions.
   (COUCHDB-83)

Build and System Integration:

 * The `couchdb` script no longer uses `awk` for configuration checks as this
   was causing portability problems.
 * Updated `sudo` example in `README` to use the `-i` option, this fixes
   problems when invoking from a directory the `couchdb` user cannot access.

Futon:

 * The view selector dropdown should now work in Opera and Internet Explorer
   even when it includes optgroups for design documents. (COUCHDB-81)

Version 0.8.0-incubating
------------------------

Database Core:

 * The view engine has been completely decoupled from the storage engine. Index
   data is now stored in separate files, and the format of the main database
   file has changed.
 * Databases can now be compacted to reclaim space used for deleted documents
   and old document revisions.
 * Support for incremental map/reduce views has been added.
 * To support map/reduce, the structure of design documents has changed. View
   values are now JSON objects containing at least a `map` member, and
   optionally a `reduce` member.
 * View servers are now identified by name (for example `javascript`) instead of
   by media type.
 * Automatically generated document IDs are now based on proper UUID generation
   using the crypto module.
 * The field `content-type` in the JSON representation of attachments has been
   renamed to `content_type` (underscore).

HTTP Interface:

 * CouchDB now uses MochiWeb instead of inets for the HTTP server
   implementation. Among other things, this means that the extra configuration
   files needed for inets (such as `couch_httpd.conf`) are no longer used.
 * The HTTP interface now completely supports the `HEAD` method. (COUCHDB-3)
 * Improved compliance of `Etag` handling with the HTTP specification.
   (COUCHDB-13)
 * Etags are no longer included in responses to document `GET` requests that
   include query string parameters causing the JSON response to change without
   the revision or the URI having changed.
 * The bulk document update API has changed slightly on both the request and the
   response side. In addition, bulk updates are now atomic.
 * CouchDB now uses `TCP_NODELAY` to fix performance problems with persistent
   connections on some platforms due to nagling.
 * Including a `?descending=false` query string parameter in requests to views
   no longer raises an error.
 * Requests to unknown top-level reserved URLs (anything with a leading
   underscore) now return a `unknown_private_path` error instead of the
   confusing `illegal_database_name`.
 * The Temporary view handling now expects a JSON request body, where the JSON
   is an object with at least a `map` member, and optional `reduce` and
   `language` members.
 * Temporary views no longer determine the view server based on the Content-Type
   header of the `POST` request, but rather by looking for a `language` member
   in the JSON body of the request.
 * The status code of responses to `DELETE` requests is now 200 to reflect that
   that the deletion is performed synchronously.

JavaScript View Server:

 * SpiderMonkey is no longer included with CouchDB, but rather treated as a
   normal external dependency. A simple C program (`_couchjs`) is provided that
   links against an existing SpiderMonkey installation and uses the interpreter
   embedding API.
 * View functions using the default JavaScript view server can now do logging
   using the global `log(message)` function. Log messages are directed into the
   CouchDB log at `INFO` level. (COUCHDB-59)
 * The global `map(key, value)` function made available to view code has been
   renamed to `emit(key, value)`.
 * Fixed handling of exceptions raised by view functions.

Build and System Integration:

 * CouchDB can automatically respawn following a server crash.
 * Database server no longer refuses to start with a stale PID file.
 * System logrotate configuration provided.
 * Improved handling of ICU shared libraries.
 * The `couchdb` script now automatically enables SMP support in Erlang.
 * The `couchdb` and `couchjs` scripts have been improved for portability.
 * The build and system integration have been improved for portability.

Futon:

 * When adding a field to a document, Futon now just adds a field with an
   autogenerated name instead of prompting for the name with a dialog. The name
   is automatically put into edit mode so that it can be changed immediately.
 * Fields are now sorted alphabetically by name when a document is displayed.
 * Futon can be used to create and update permanent views.
 * The maximum number of rows to display per page on the database page can now
   be adjusted.
 * Futon now uses the XMLHTTPRequest API asynchronously to communicate with the
   CouchDB HTTP server, so that most operations no longer block the browser.
 * View results sorting can now be switched between ascending and descending by
   clicking on the `Key` column header.
 * Fixed a bug where documents that contained a `@` character could not be
   viewed. (COUCHDB-12)
 * The database page now provides a `Compact` button to trigger database
   compaction. (COUCHDB-38)
 * Fixed portential double encoding of document IDs and other URI segments in
   many instances. (COUCHDB-39)
 * Improved display of attachments.
 * The JavaScript Shell has been removed due to unresolved licensing issues.
