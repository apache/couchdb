Version 0.11.0
--------------

Security:

 * Fixed CVE-2010-0009: Apache CouchDB Timing Attack Vulnerability.
 * Added default cookie-authentication and users database.
 * Added Futon user interface for user signup and login.
 * Added per-database reader access control lists.
 * Added per-database security object for configuration data in validation
   functions.
 * Added proxy authentication handler

HTTP Interface:

 * Provide Content-MD5 header support for attachments.
 * Added URL Rewriter handler.
 * Added virtual host handling.

View Server:

 * Added optional 'raw' binary collation for faster view builds where Unicode
   collation is not important.
 * Improved view index build time by reducing ICU collation callouts.
 * Improved view information objects.
 * Bug fix for partial updates during view builds.
 * Move query server to a design-doc based protocol.
 * Use json2.js for JSON serialization for compatiblity with native JSON.
 * Major refactoring of couchjs to lay the groundwork for disabling cURL
   support. The new HTTP interaction acts like a synchronous XHR. Example usage
   of the new system is in the JavaScript CLI test runner.

Replication:

 * Added option to implicitly create replication target databases.
 * Avoid leaking file descriptors on automatic replication restarts.
 * Added option to replicate a list of documents by id.
 * Allow continuous replication to be cancelled.

Storage System:

 * Adds batching of multiple updating requests, to improve throughput with many
   writers. Removed the now redundant couch_batch_save module.

Runtime Statistics:

 * Statistics are now calculated for a moving window instead of non-overlapping
   timeframes.
 * Fixed a problem with statistics timers and system sleep.
 * Moved statistic names to a term file in the priv directory.

Futon:

 * Added a button for view compaction.
 * JSON strings are now displayed as-is in the document view, without the escaping of
   new-lines and quotes. That dramatically improves readability of multi-line
   strings.
 * Same goes for editing of JSON string values. When a change to a field value is
   submitted, and the value is not valid JSON it is assumed to be a string. This
   improves editing of multi-line strings a lot.

   inserts a tab character at the current caret position.
 * Fixed some font declarations.

Version 0.8.1-incubating
------------------------

Database Core:

 * Fix for replication problems where the write queues can get backed up if the
   writes aren't happening fast enough to keep up with the reads. For a large
   replication, this can exhaust memory and crash, or slow down the machine
   dramatically. The fix keeps only one document in the write queue at a time.
 * Fix for databases sometimes incorrectly reporting that they contain 0
   documents after compaction.
 * CouchDB now uses ibrowse instead of inets for its internal HTTP client
   implementation. This means better replication stability.

HTTP Interface:

 * Fix for chunked responses where chunks were always being split into multiple
   TCP packets, which caused problems with the test suite under Safari, and in
   some other cases.
 * Fix for an invalid JSON response body being returned for some kinds of
   views. (COUCHDB-84)
 * Fix for connections not getting closed after rejecting a chunked request.
   (COUCHDB-55)
 * CouchDB can now be bound to IPv6 addresses.
 * The HTTP `Server` header now contains the versions of CouchDB and Erlang.

JavaScript View Server:

 * Sealing of documents has been disabled due to an incompatibility with
   SpiderMonkey 1.9.
 * Improve error handling for undefined values emitted by map functions.
   (COUCHDB-83)

Build and System Integration:

 * The `couchdb` script no longer uses `awk` for configuration checks as this
   was causing portability problems.
 * Updated `sudo` example in `README` to use the `-i` option, this fixes
   problems when invoking from a directory the `couchdb` user cannot access.

Futon:

 * The view selector dropdown should now work in Opera and Internet Explorer
   even when it includes optgroups for design documents. (COUCHDB-81)

Version 0.8.0-incubating
------------------------

Database Core:

 * The view engine has been completely decoupled from the storage engine. Index
   data is now stored in separate files, and the format of the main database
   file has changed.
 * Databases can now be compacted to reclaim space used for deleted documents
   and old document revisions.
 * Support for incremental map/reduce views has been added.
 * To support map/reduce, the structure of design documents has changed. View
   values are now JSON objects containing at least a `map` member, and
   optionally a `reduce` member.
 * View servers are now identified by name (for example `javascript`) instead of
   by media type.
 * Automatically generated document IDs are now based on proper UUID generation
   using the crypto module.
 * The field `content-type` in the JSON representation of attachments has been
   renamed to `content_type` (underscore).

HTTP Interface:

 * CouchDB now uses MochiWeb instead of inets for the HTTP server
   implementation. Among other things, this means that the extra configuration
   files needed for inets (such as `couch_httpd.conf`) are no longer used.
 * The HTTP interface now completely supports the `HEAD` method. (COUCHDB-3)
 * Improved compliance of `Etag` handling with the HTTP specification.
   (COUCHDB-13)
 * Etags are no longer included in responses to document `GET` requests that
   include query string parameters causing the JSON response to change without
   the revision or the URI having changed.
 * The bulk document update API has changed slightly on both the request and the
   response side. In addition, bulk updates are now atomic.
 * CouchDB now uses `TCP_NODELAY` to fix performance problems with persistent
   connections on some platforms due to nagling.
 * Including a `?descending=false` query string parameter in requests to views
   no longer raises an error.
 * Requests to unknown top-level reserved URLs (anything with a leading
   underscore) now return a `unknown_private_path` error instead of the
   confusing `illegal_database_name`.
 * The Temporary view handling now expects a JSON request body, where the JSON
   is an object with at least a `map` member, and optional `reduce` and
   `language` members.
 * Temporary views no longer determine the view server based on the Content-Type
   header of the `POST` request, but rather by looking for a `language` member
   in the JSON body of the request.
 * The status code of responses to `DELETE` requests is now 200 to reflect that
   that the deletion is performed synchronously.

JavaScript View Server:

 * SpiderMonkey is no longer included with CouchDB, but rather treated as a
   normal external dependency. A simple C program (`_couchjs`) is provided that
   links against an existing SpiderMonkey installation and uses the interpreter
   embedding API.
 * View functions using the default JavaScript view server can now do logging
   using the global `log(message)` function. Log messages are directed into the
   CouchDB log at `INFO` level. (COUCHDB-59)
 * The global `map(key, value)` function made available to view code has been
   renamed to `emit(key, value)`.
 * Fixed handling of exceptions raised by view functions.

Build and System Integration:

 * CouchDB can automatically respawn following a server crash.
 * Database server no longer refuses to start with a stale PID file.
 * System logrotate configuration provided.
 * Improved handling of ICU shared libraries.
 * The `couchdb` script now automatically enables SMP support in Erlang.
 * The `couchdb` and `couchjs` scripts have been improved for portability.
 * The build and system integration have been improved for portability.

Futon:

 * When adding a field to a document, Futon now just adds a field with an
   autogenerated name instead of prompting for the name with a dialog. The name
   is automatically put into edit mode so that it can be changed immediately.
 * Fields are now sorted alphabetically by name when a document is displayed.
 * Futon can be used to create and update permanent views.
 * The maximum number of rows to display per page on the database page can now
   be adjusted.
 * Futon now uses the XMLHTTPRequest API asynchronously to communicate with the
   CouchDB HTTP server, so that most operations no longer block the browser.
 * View results sorting can now be switched between ascending and descending by
   clicking on the `Key` column header.
 * Fixed a bug where documents that contained a `@` character could not be
   viewed. (COUCHDB-12)
 * The database page now provides a `Compact` button to trigger database
   compaction. (COUCHDB-38)
 * Fixed portential double encoding of document IDs and other URI segments in
   many instances. (COUCHDB-39)
 * Improved display of attachments.
 * The JavaScript Shell has been removed due to unresolved licensing issues.
