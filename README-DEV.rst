Apache CouchDB DEVELOPERS
=========================

Before you start here, read `INSTALL.Unix` (or `INSTALL.Windows`) and
follow the setup instructions including the installation of all the
listed dependencies for your system.

Only follow these instructions if you are building from a source checkout.

If you're unsure what this means, ignore this document.

Dependencies
------------

You may need:

* `Sphinx                 <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
* `LaTex                  <http://www.latex-project.org/>`_
* `GNU Texinfo            <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>`_
* `GNU help2man           <http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/>`_
* `GnuPG                  <http://www.gnupg.org/>`_
* `md5sum                 <http://www.microbrew.org/tools/md5sha1sum/>`_
* `sha1sum                <http://www.microbrew.org/tools/md5sha1sum/>`_

The first of these optional dependencies are required for building the
documentation. The last three are needed to build releases.

You will need these optional dependencies installed if:

* You are working on the documentation, or
* You are preparing a distribution archive

However, you do not need them if:

* You are building from a distribution archive, or
* You don't care about building the documentation

If you intend to build Fauxton, you will also need to install its
dependencies. After running ./configure to download all of the
dependent repositories, you can read about required dependencies in
`src/fauxton/readme.md`. Typically, installing npm and node.js are
sufficient to enable a Fauxton build.

Here is a list of *optional* dependencies for various operating systems.
Installation will be easiest, when you install them all.

Debian-based (inc. Ubuntu) Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sudo apt-get install help2man python-sphinx \
        texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended \
        texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended texinfo gnupg

Gentoo-based Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sudo emerge texinfo gnupg coreutils pkgconfig help2man
    sudo USE=latex emerge sphinx

RedHat-based (Fedora, Centos, RHEL) Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    sudo yum install help2man python-sphinx python-docutils \
        python-pygments texlive-latex texlive-latex-fonts texinfo gnupg

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

Install `Homebrew <https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew>`_, if you do not have 
it already.

Unless you want to install the optional dependencies, skip to the next section.

Install what else we can with Homebrew::

    brew install help2man gnupg md5sha1sum

If you don't already have pip installed, install it::

    sudo easy_install pip

Now, install the required Python packages::

    sudo pip install sphinx
    sudo pip install docutils
    sudo pip install pygments

Download `MacTeX <http://www.tug.org/mactex/>`_ and follow the instructions 
to get a working LaTeX install on your system.

FreeBSD
~~~~~~~

::

    pkg install help2man texinfo gnupg py27-sphinx texlive-full tex-formats

Windows
~~~~~~~

Follow the instructions in `INSTALL.Windows` and build all components from
source, using the same Visual C++ compiler and runtime.

Configuring
-----------

Configure the source by running::

    ./configure

If you intend to run the test suites::

    ./configure -c

If you want to build it into different destination than `/usr/local`.:

    ./configure --prefix=/<your directory path>

If you don't want to build Fauxton or documentation specify ``--disable-fauxton``
and/or ``--disable-docs`` arguments for `configure` to ignore their build and
avoid any issues with their dependencies.

See ``./configure --help`` for more information.

Testing
-------

To run all the tests use run::

    make check

You can also run each test suite individually via ``eunit`` and ``javascript``
targets::

    make eunit
    make javascript

If you need to run specific Erlang tests, you can pass special "options"
to make targets::

    # Run tests only for couch and chttpd apps
    make eunit apps=couch,chttpd

    # Run only tests from couch_btree_tests suite
    make eunit suites=couch_btree_tests

    # Run only only specific tests
    make eunit tests=btree_open_test,reductions_test

    # Ignore tests for specified apps
    make eunit skip_deps=couch_log,couch_epi

The ``apps``, ``suites``, ``tests`` and ``skip_deps`` could be combined in any 
way. These are mimics to ``rebar eunit`` arguments. If you're not satisfied by 
these, you can use EUNIT_OPT environment variable to specify exact `rebar eunit`
options::

    make eunit EUNIT_OPTS="apps=couch,chttpd"

JavaScript tests accepts only `suites` option, but in the same way::

    # Run all JavaScript tests
    make javascript

    # Run only basic and design_options tests
    make javascript suites="basic design_options"

Note that tests are delimited here by whitespace, not by comma. You can get list
of all possible test targets with the following command::

    make list-js-suites

Code analyzer could be run by::

    make dialyze

If you need to analyze only specific apps, you can specify them in familiar way
::

    make dialyze apps=couch,couch_epi

See ``make help`` for more info and useful commands.

Please report any problems to the developer's mailing list.

Testing a cluster
-----------------

We use `Docker <https://docker.io>`_ to safely run a local three node
cluster all inside a single docker container.

Assuming you have Docker installed and running::

    make docker-image

This will create a docker image (tagged 'couchdb/dev-cluster') capable
of running a joined three node cluster.

To start it up::

    make docker-start

A three node cluster should now be running (you can now use ``docker ps``
to find the exposed ports of the nodes).

To stop it::

    make docker-stop

Releasing
---------

The release procedure is documented here::

    https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Release_Procedure

Unix-like Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the release artifacts by running::

    make distcheck

You can prepare signed release artifacts by running::

    make distsign

The release artifacts can be found in the root source directory.

Microsoft Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the release artifacts by running::

    make dist

The release artifacts can be found in the `etc/windows` directory.

Until the build system has been improved, you must make sure that you run this
command from a clean source checkout. If you do not, your test database and log
files will be bundled up in the release artifacts.
