    % Some startup order constraints based on call dependencies:
    %
    % * mem3_events gen_event should be started before all the others
    %
    % * mem3_nodes gen_server is needed so everyone can call mem3:nodes()
    %
    % * mem3_sync_nodes needs to run before mem3_sync and
    %   mem3_sync_event_listener, so they can both can call
    %   mem3_sync_nodes:add/1
    %
    % * mem3_distribution force connects nodes from mem3:nodes(), so start it
    %   before mem3_sync since mem3_sync:initial_sync/0 expects the connected
    %   nodes to be there when calling mem3_sync_nodes:add(nodes())
    %
    % * mem3_sync_event_listener has to start after mem3_sync, so it can call
    %   mem3_sync:push/2
    %
    % * mem3_seeds and mem3_reshard_sup can wait till the end, as they will
    %   spawn background work that can go on for a while: seeding system dbs
    %   from other nodes running resharding jobs
