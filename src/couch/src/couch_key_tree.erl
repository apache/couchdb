%% @doc Data structure used to represent document edit histories.

%% A key tree is used to represent the edit history of a document. Each node of
%% the tree represents a particular version. Relations between nodes represent
%% the order that these edits were applied. For instance, a set of three edits
%% would produce a tree of versions A->B->C indicating that edit C was based on
%% version B which was in turn based on A. In a world without replication (and
%% no ability to disable MVCC checks), all histories would be forced to be
%% linear lists of edits due to constraints imposed by MVCC (ie, new edits must
%% be based on the current version). However, we have replication, so we must
%% deal with not so easy cases, which lead to trees.
%%
%% Consider a document in state A. This doc is replicated to a second node. We
%% then edit the document on each node leaving it in two different states, B
%% and C. We now have two key trees, A->B and A->C. When we go to replicate a
%% second time, the key tree must combine these two trees which gives us
%% A->(B|C). This is how conflicts are introduced. In terms of the key tree, we
%% say that we have two leaves (B and C) that are not deleted. The presense of
%% the multiple leaves indicate conflict. To remove a conflict, one of the
%% edits (B or C) can be deleted, which results in, A->(B|C->D) where D is an
%% edit that is specially marked with the a deleted=true flag.
%%
%% What makes this a bit more complicated is that there is a limit to the
%% number of revisions kept, specified in couch_db.hrl (default is 1000). When
%% this limit is exceeded only the last 1000 are kept. This comes in to play
%% when branches are merged. The comparison has to begin at the same place in
%% the branches. A revision id is of the form N-XXXXXXX where N is the current
%% revision depth. So each path will have a start number, calculated in
%% couch_doc:to_path using the formula N - length(RevIds) + 1 So, .eg. if a doc
%% was edit 1003 times this start number would be 4, indicating that 3
%% revisions were truncated.
%%
%% This comes into play in @see merge_at/3 which recursively walks down one
%% tree or the other until they begin at the same revision.
