==============================
cURL: Your Command Line Friend
==============================

The ``curl`` utility is a command line tool available on Unix, Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows, and many other platforms. ``curl`` provides easy access to the HTTP
protocol (among others) directly from the command line and is therefore an
ideal way of interacting with CouchDB over the HTTP REST API.

For simple ``GET`` requests you can supply the URL of the request. For example,
to get the database information:

.. code-block:: bash

    shell> curl http://admin:password@127.0.0.1:5984

This returns the database information (formatted in the output below for
clarity):

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "couchdb": "Welcome",
      "version": "3.0.0",
      "git_sha": "83bdcf693",
      "uuid": "56f16e7c93ff4a2dc20eb6acc7000b71",
      "features": [
        "access-ready",
        "partitioned",
        "pluggable-storage-engines",
        "reshard",
        "scheduler"
      ],
      "vendor": {
        "name": "The Apache Software Foundation"
      }
    }

.. note::
    For some URLs, especially those that include special characters such as
    ampersand, exclamation mark, or question mark, you should quote the URL you
    are specifying on the command line. For example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        shell> curl 'http://couchdb:5984/_uuids?count=5'

.. note::
    On Microsoft Windows, use double-quotes anywhere you see single-quotes in
    the following examples. Use doubled double-quotes ("") anywhere you see
    single double-quotes. For example, if you see:

    .. code-block:: bash

        shell> curl -X PUT 'http://127.0.0.1:5984/demo/doc' -d '{"motto": "I love gnomes"}'

    you should replace it with:

    .. code-blocK:: bash

        shell> curl -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:5984/demo/doc" -d "{""motto"": ""I love gnomes""}"

    If you prefer, ``^"`` and ``\"`` may be used to escape the double-quote
    character in quoted strings instead.

You can explicitly set the HTTP command using the ``-X`` command line option.
For example, when creating a database, you set the name of the database in the
URL you send using a PUT request:

.. code-block:: bash

    shell> curl -X PUT http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5984/demo
    {"ok":true}

But to obtain the database information you use a ``GET`` request (with
the return information formatted for clarity):

.. code-block:: bash

    shell> curl -X GET http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5984/demo
    {
        "compact_running" : false,
        "doc_count" : 0,
        "db_name" : "demo",
        "purge_seq" : 0,
        "committed_update_seq" : 0,
        "doc_del_count" : 0,
        "disk_format_version" : 5,
        "update_seq" : 0,
        "instance_start_time" : "0",
        "disk_size" : 79
    }

For certain operations, you must specify the content type of request, which you
do by specifying the ``Content-Type`` header using the ``-H`` command-line
option:

.. code-block:: bash

    shell> curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://127.0.0.1:5984/_uuids

You can also submit 'payload' data, that is, data in the body of the HTTP
request using the ``-d`` option. This is useful if you need to submit JSON
structures, for example document data, as part of the request. For example, to
submit a simple document to the ``demo`` database:

.. code-block:: bash

    shell> curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                -X POST http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5984/demo \
                -d '{"company": "Example, Inc."}'
    {"ok":true,"id":"8843faaf0b831d364278331bc3001bd8",
     "rev":"1-33b9fbce46930280dab37d672bbc8bb9"}

In the above example, the argument after the ``-d`` option is the JSON of the
document we want to submit.

The document can be accessed by using the automatically generated document ID
that was returned:

.. code-block:: bash

    shell> curl -X GET http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5984/demo/8843faaf0b831d364278331bc3001bd8
    {"_id":"8843faaf0b831d364278331bc3001bd8",
     "_rev":"1-33b9fbce46930280dab37d672bbc8bb9",
     "company":"Example, Inc."}

The API samples in the :ref:`api/basics` show the HTTP command, URL and any
payload information that needs to be submitted (and the expected return value).
All of these examples can be reproduced using ``curl`` with the command-line
examples shown above.
