Introduction
============

CouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your data with
JSON documents. Access your documents with your web browser, :ref:`via HTTP
<api/basics>`. :ref:`Query <api/doc>`, :ref:`combine <views>`, and
:ref:`transform <listfun>` your documents with :ref:`JavaScript
<query-server/js>`. CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps.  You
can distribute your data, efficiently using CouchDBâ€™s :ref:`incremental
replication <replication/intro>`. CouchDB supports master-master setups with
:ref:`automatic conflict <replication/conflicts>` detection.

CouchDB comes with a suite of features, such as on-the-fly document
transformation and real-time :ref:`change notifications <changes>`, that make
web development a breeze. It even comes with an easy to use web administration
console, served directly out of CouchDB! We care a lot about `distributed
scaling`_.  CouchDB is highly available and partition tolerant, but is also
:ref:`eventually consistent <intro/consistency>`. And we care *a lot* about
your data.  CouchDB has a fault-tolerant storage engine that puts the safety
of your data first.

In this section you'll learn about every basic bit of CouchDB, see upon what
conceptions and technologies it built and walk through short tutorial that
teach how to use CouchDB.
