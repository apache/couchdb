    load on the server so it is advisable to have more requests with 100 dbs,
    rather than a few requests with 1000s of dbs at a time.

    - ``single_node_disabled``: The current node is configured as a single
      (standalone) node (``[cluster] n=1``), but either does not have a
      server-level admin user defined, or does not have the standard system
      databases created. If the ``ensure_dbs_exist`` query parameter is
      specified, the list of databases provided overrides the default list
      of standard system databases.
    - ``single_node_enabled``: The current node is configured as a single
      (standalone) node, has a server-level admin user defined, and has
      the ``ensure_dbs_exist`` list (explicit or default) of databases
      created.
    - ``cluster_enabled``: The current node has ``[cluster] n`` > 1, is not
      bound to ``127.0.0.1`` and has a server-level admin user defined.
      However, the full set of standard system databases have not been
      created yet. If the ``ensure_dbs_exist`` query parameter is
      specified, the list of databases provided overrides the default list
      of standard system databases.
    - ``cluster_finished``: The current node has ``[cluster] n`` > 1, is not
      bound to ``127.0.0.1``, has a server-level admin user defined *and*
      has the ``ensure_dbs_exist`` list (explicit or default) of databases
      created.

Replication Operation
=====================

The aim of the replication is that at the end of the process, all active
documents on the source database are also in the destination database and all
documents that were deleted in the source databases are also deleted (if they
exist) on the destination database.

Replication can be described as either push or pull replication:

- *Pull replication* is where the ``source`` is the remote CouchDB instance,
  and the ``target`` is the local database.

  Pull replication is the most useful solution to use if your source database
  has a permanent IP address, and your destination (local) database may have a
  dynamically assigned IP address (for example, through DHCP). This is
  particularly important if you are replicating to a mobile or other device
  from a central server.

- *Push replication* is where the ``source`` is a local database, and
  ``target`` is a remote database.

Specifying the Source and Target Database
=========================================

You must use the URL specification of the CouchDB database if you want to
perform replication in either of the following two situations:

- Replication with a remote database (i.e. another instance of CouchDB on the
  same host, or a different host)

- Replication with a database that requires authentication

For example, to request replication between a database local to the CouchDB
instance to which you send the request, and a remote database you might use the
following request:

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

    {
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "http://coucdb-remote:5984/recipes",
    }

In all cases, the requested databases in the ``source`` and ``target``
specification must exist. If they do not, an error will be returned within the
JSON object:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "error" : "db_not_found"
        "reason" : "could not open http://couchdb-remote:5984/ol1ka/",
    }

You can create the target database (providing your user credentials allow it)
by adding the ``create_target`` field to the request object:

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

    {
        "create_target" : true
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "http://couchdb-remote:5984/recipes",
    }

The ``create_target`` field is not destructive. If the database already
exists, the replication proceeds as normal.

Single Replication
==================

You can request replication of a database so that the two databases can be
synchronized. By default, the replication process occurs one time and
synchronizes the two databases together. For example, you can request a single
synchronization between two databases by supplying the ``source`` and
``target`` fields within the request JSON content.

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "recipes-snapshot",
    }

In the above example, the databases ``recipes`` and ``recipes-snapshot`` will
be synchronized. These databases are local to the CouchDB instance where the
request was made. The response will be a JSON structure containing the success
(or failure) of the synchronization process, and statistics about the process:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "ok" : true,
        "history" : [
            {
                "docs_read" : 1000,
                "bulk_get_attempts": 1000,
                "bulk_get_docs": 1000,
                "session_id" : "52c2370f5027043d286daca4de247db0",
                "recorded_seq" : 1000,
                "end_last_seq" : 1000,
                "doc_write_failures" : 0,
                "start_time" : "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 10:24:13 GMT",
                "start_last_seq" : 0,
                "end_time" : "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 10:24:14 GMT",
                "missing_checked" : 0,
                "docs_written" : 1000,
                "missing_found" : 1000
            }
        ],
        "session_id" : "52c2370f5027043d286daca4de247db0",
        "source_last_seq" : 1000
    }

Continuous Replication
======================

Synchronization of a database with the previously noted methods happens only
once, at the time the replicate request is made. To have the target database
permanently replicated from the source, you must set the ``continuous`` field
of the JSON object within the request to true.

With continuous replication changes in the source database are replicated to
the target database in perpetuity until you specifically request that
replication ceases.

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "continuous" : true
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "http://couchdb-remote:5984/recipes",
    }

Changes will be replicated between the two databases as long as a network
connection is available between the two instances.

.. note::
    Two keep two databases synchronized with each other, you need to set
    replication in both directions; that is, you must replicate from ``source``
    to ``target``, and separately from ``target`` to ``source``.

Canceling Continuous Replication
================================

You can cancel continuous replication by adding the ``cancel`` field to the
JSON request object and setting the value to true. Note that the structure of
the request must be identical to the original for the cancellation request to
be honoured. For example, if you requested continuous replication, the
cancellation request must also contain the ``continuous`` field.

For example, the replication request:

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

    {
        "source" : "recipes",
        "target" : "http://couchdb-remote:5984/recipes",
        "create_target" : true,
        "continuous" : true
    }

Must be canceled using the request:

.. code-block:: http

    POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json

    :synopsis: Retrieve information about replication jobs

    List of replication jobs. Includes replications created via
    :ref:`api/server/replicate` endpoint as well as those created from
    replication documents. Does not include replications which have completed
    or have failed to start because replication documents were malformed. Each
    job description will include source and target information, replication id,
    a history of recent event, and a few other things.

.. http:get:: /_node/{node-name}
    :synopsis: Returns node name

    The ``/_node/{node-name}`` endpoint can be used to confirm the Erlang
    node name of the server that processes the request. This is most useful
    when accessing ``/_node/_local`` to retrieve this information. Repeatedly
    retrieving this information for a CouchDB endpoint can be useful to determine
    if a CouchDB cluster is correctly proxied through a reverse load balancer.

.. _api/server/stats:

=============================
``/_node/{node-name}/_stats``
=============================

.. http:get:: /_node/{node-name}/_stats
    :synopsis: Returns server statistics

    The ``_stats`` resource returns a JSON object containing the statistics
    for the running server. The object is structured with top-level sections
    collating the statistics for a range of entries, with each individual
    statistic being easily identified, and the content of each statistic is
    self-describing.

    Statistics are sampled internally on a :ref:`configurable interval
    <config/stats>`. When monitoring the ``_stats`` endpoint, you need to use
    a polling frequency of at least twice this to observe accurate results.
    For example, if the :ref:`interval <config/stats>` is 10 seconds,
    poll ``_stats`` at least every 5 seconds.

    The literal string ``_local`` serves as an alias for the local node name, so
    for all stats URLs, ``{node-name}`` may be replaced with ``_local``, to
    interact with the local node's statistics.

The fields provide the current, minimum and maximum, and a collection of
statistical means and quantities. The quantity in each case is not defined, but
the descriptions below provide sufficient detail to determine units.

Statistics are reported by 'group'.  The statistics are divided into the
following top-level sections:

- ``couch_log``: Logging subsystem
- ``couch_replicator``: Replication scheduler and subsystem
- ``couchdb``: Primary CouchDB database operations
- ``fabric``: Cluster-related operations
- ``global_changes``: Global changes feed
- ``mem3``: Node membership-related statistics
- ``pread``: CouchDB file-related exceptions
- ``rexi``: Cluster internal RPC-related statistics

The type of the statistic is included in the ``type`` field, and is one of
the following:

- ``counter``: Monotonically increasing counter, resets on restart
- ``histogram``: Binned set of values with meaningful subdivisions.
  Scoped to the current :ref:`collection interval <config/stats>`.
- ``gauge``: Single numerical value that can go up and down

You can also access individual statistics by quoting the statistics sections
and statistic ID as part of the URL path. For example, to get the
``request_time`` statistics within the ``couchdb`` section for the target
node, you can use:

.. code-block:: http

    GET /_node/_local/_stats/couchdb/request_time HTTP/1.1

This returns an entire statistics object, as with the full request, but
containing only the requested individual statistic.

.. _api/server/prometheus:

==================================
``/_node/{node-name}/_prometheus``
==================================

.. http:get:: /_node/{node-name}/_prometheus
    :synopsis: Returns server statistics in prometheus format

    The ``_prometheus`` resource returns a text/plain response that consolidates our
    :ref:`api/server/stats`, and :ref:`api/server/system` endpoints. The format is
    determined by `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/>`_.
    The format version is 2.0.

If an additional port config option is specified, then a client can call this API using
that port which does not require authentication. This option is ``false`` (OFF)
by default. When the option is ``true`` (ON), the default ports for a 3 node cluster
are ``17986``, ``27986``, ``37986``.
See :ref:`Configuration of Prometheus Endpoint <config/prometheus>` for details.

.. http:get:: /_node/{node-name}/_system
    :synopsis: Returns system-level server statistics

    The ``_system`` resource returns a JSON object containing various
    system-level statistics for the running server. The object is structured
    with top-level sections collating the statistics for a range of entries,
    with each individual statistic being easily identified, and the content of
    each statistic is self-describing.

    The literal string ``_local`` serves as an alias for the local node name, so
    for all stats URLs, ``{node-name}`` may be replaced with ``_local``, to
    interact with the local node's statistics.

The UUID type is determined by the :config:option:`UUID algorithm
<uuids/algorithm>` setting in the CouchDB configuration.

The UUID type may be changed at any time through the
:ref:`Configuration API <api/config/section/key>`. For example, the UUID type
could be changed to ``random`` by sending this HTTP request:

.. code-block:: http

    PUT http://couchdb:5984/_node/nonode@nohost/_config/uuids/algorithm HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: */*

    "random"

You can verify the change by obtaining a list of UUIDs:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "uuids" : [
            "031aad7b469956cf2826fcb2a9260492",

    Each result object represents a single resharding job for a particular node
    and range. Some of the responses could be successful and some could fail.
    Successful results will have the ``"ok": true`` key and and value, and
    failed jobs will have the ``"error": "{error_message}"`` key and value.
