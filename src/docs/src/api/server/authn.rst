    We also strongly recommend you :ref:`set up SSL <config/ssl>` to
    improve all authentication methods' security.

.. _api/auth/basic:

Basic Authentication
====================

`Basic authentication`_ (:rfc:`2617`) is a quick and simple way to authenticate
with CouchDB. The main drawback is the need to send user credentials with each
request which may be insecure and could hurt operation performance (since
CouchDB must compute the password hash with every request):

**Request**:

.. code-block:: http

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: Basic cm9vdDpyZWxheA==
    Host: localhost:5984

**Response**:

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

        }
    }

.. _api/auth/cookie:

Cookie Authentication
=====================

For cookie authentication (:rfc:`2109`) CouchDB generates a token that the
client can use for the next few requests to CouchDB. Tokens are valid until
a timeout. When CouchDB sees a valid token in a subsequent request, it will
authenticate the user by this token without requesting the password again. By
default, cookies are valid for 10 minutes, but it's adjustable via :config:option:`timeout
<chttpd_auth/timeout>`. Also it's possible to make cookies
:config:option:`persistent <chttpd_auth/allow_persistent_cookies>`.

To obtain the first token and thus authenticate a user for the first time, the
``username`` and ``password`` must be sent to the :ref:`_session API
<api/auth/session>`.

.. _api/auth/session:

``/_session``

    Closes user's session by instructing the browser to clear the cookie. This
    does not invalidate the session from the server's perspective, as there is
    no way to do this because CouchDB cookies are stateless. This means calling
    this endpoint is purely optional from a client perspective, and it does not
    protect against theft of a session cookie.

        }

.. _api/auth/proxy:

Proxy Authentication
====================

.. note::
    To use this authentication method make sure that the
    ``{chttpd_auth, proxy_authentication_handler}`` value is added to the
    list of the active :config:option:`chttpd/authentication_handlers`:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [chttpd]
        authentication_handlers = {chttpd_auth, cookie_authentication_handler}, {chttpd_auth, proxy_authentication_handler}, {chttpd_auth, default_authentication_handler}

`Proxy authentication` is very useful in case your application already uses
some external authentication service and you don't want to duplicate users and
their roles in CouchDB.

This authentication method allows creation of a :ref:`userctx_object` for
remotely authenticated user. By default, the client just needs to pass specific
headers to CouchDB with related requests:

- :config:option:`X-Auth-CouchDB-UserName <chttpd_auth/x_auth_username>`:
  username;
- :config:option:`X-Auth-CouchDB-Roles <chttpd_auth/x_auth_roles>`:
  comma-separated (``,``) list of user roles;
- :config:option:`X-Auth-CouchDB-Token <chttpd_auth/x_auth_token>`:
  authentication token. When
  :config:option:`proxy_use_secret <chttpd_auth/proxy_use_secret>`
  is set (which is strongly recommended!), this header provides an HMAC of the
  username to authenticate and the secret token to prevent requests from
  untrusted sources. (Use the SHA1 of the username and sign with the secret)

**Creating the token (example with openssl)**:

.. code-block:: sh

    echo -n "foo" | openssl dgst -sha1 -hmac "the_secret"
    # (stdin)= 22047ebd7c4ec67dfbcbad7213a693249dbfbf86

**Request**:

.. code-block:: http

    GET /_session HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:5984
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    X-Auth-CouchDB-Roles: users,blogger
    X-Auth-CouchDB-UserName: foo
    X-Auth-CouchDB-Token: 22047ebd7c4ec67dfbcbad7213a693249dbfbf86

**Response**:

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Cache-Control: must-revalidate
    Content-Length: 190
    Content-Type: application/json
    Date: Fri, 14 Jun 2013 10:16:03 GMT
    Server: CouchDB (Erlang/OTP)

    {
        "info": {
            "authenticated": "proxy",
            "authentication_db": "_users",
            "authentication_handlers": [
                "cookie",
                "proxy",
                "default"
            ]
        },

                "blogger"
            ]
        }
    }

Note that you don't need to request :ref:`session <api/auth/session>`
to be authenticated by this method if all required HTTP headers are provided.

.. _api/auth/jwt:

JWT Authentication
====================

.. note::
    To use this authentication method, make sure that the
    ``{chttpd_auth, jwt_authentication_handler}`` value is added to the
    list of the active :config:option:`chttpd/authentication_handlers`:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [chttpd]
        authentication_handlers = {chttpd_auth, cookie_authentication_handler}, {chttpd_auth, jwt_authentication_handler}, {chttpd_auth, default_authentication_handler}

``JWT authentication`` enables CouchDB to use externally-generated JWT tokens
instead of defining users or roles in the ``_users`` database.

The JWT authentication handler requires that all JWT tokens are signed by a key that
CouchDB has been configured to trust (there is no support for JWT's "NONE" algorithm).

Additionally, CouchDB can be configured to reject JWT tokens that are
missing a configurable set of claims (e.g, a CouchDB administrator
could insist on the ``exp`` claim).

Only claims listed in required checks are validated. Additional claims will be ignored.

Two sections of config exist to configure JWT authentication;

The :config:option:`required_claims <jwt_auth/required_claims>` config
setting is a comma-separated list of additional mandatory JWT claims
that must be present in any presented JWT token. A :statuscode:`400`
is sent if any are missing.

The ``alg`` claim is mandatory as it used to lookup the correct key for verifying the
signature.

The ``sub`` claim is mandatory and is used as the CouchDB user's name if the JWT token
is valid.

You can set the user roles claim name through the config setting
:config:option:`roles_claim_name <jwt_auth/roles_claim_name>`. If you don't set
an explicit value, then ``_couchdb.roles`` will be set as the default claim name.
If presented, as a JSON array of strings, it is used as the CouchDB user's roles
list as long as the JWT token is valid.

.. warning::

    ``roles_claim_name`` is deprecated in CouchDB 3.3, and will be removed later.
    Please use :config:option:`roles_claim_path <jwt_auth/roles_claim_path>`.

.. code-block:: ini

    ; [jwt_keys]
    ; Configure at least one key here if using the JWT auth handler.
    ; If your JWT tokens do not include a "kid" attribute, use "_default"
    ; as the config key, otherwise use the kid as the config key.
    ; Examples
    ; hmac:_default = aGVsbG8=
    ; hmac:foo = aGVsbG8=
    ; The config values can represent symmetric and asymmetric keys.
    ; For symmetric keys, the value is base64 encoded;
    ; hmac:_default = aGVsbG8= # base64-encoded form of "hello"
    ; For asymmetric keys, the value is the PEM encoding of the public
    ; key with newlines replaced with the escape sequence \n.
    ; rsa:foo = -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjAN...IDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n
    ; ec:bar = -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMHYwEAYHK...AzztRs\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n

The ``jwt_keys`` section lists all the keys that this CouchDB server trusts. You
should ensure that all nodes of your cluster have the same list.

Since version 3.3 it's possible to use ``=`` in parameter names, but only when
the parameter and value are separated `` = ``, i.e. the equal sign is
surrounded by at least one space on each side. This might be useful in the
``[jwt_keys]`` section where base64 encoded keys may contain the ``=``
character.

JWT tokens that do not include a ``kid`` claim will be validated against the
``$alg:_default`` key.

It is mandatory to specify the algorithm associated with every key for security
reasons (notably presenting a HMAC-signed token using an RSA or EC public key
that the server trusts:
https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/).
