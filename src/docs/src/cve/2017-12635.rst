CVE-2017-12635: Apache CouchDB Remote Privilege Escalation
==========================================================

:Date: 14.11.2017

:Affected: All Versions of Apache CouchDB

:Severity: Critical

:Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Description
===========

Due to differences in CouchDBâ€™s Erlang-based JSON parser and JavaScript-based
JSON parser, it is possible to submit _users documents with duplicate keys for
`roles` used for access control within the database, including the special case
`_admin` role, that denotes administrative users. In combination with
:ref:`CVE-2017-12636 <cve/2017-12636>` (Remote Code Execution), this can be used
to give non-admin users access to arbitrary shell commands on the server as the
database system user.

Mitigation
==========

All users should upgrade to CouchDB :ref:`1.7.1 <release/1.7.1>` or
:ref:`2.1.1 <release/2.1.1>`.

Upgrades from previous 1.x and 2.x versions in the same series should be
seamless.

Users on earlier versions, or users upgrading from 1.x to 2.x should consult
with upgrade notes.

Example
=======

The JSON parser differences result in behaviour that if two `roles` keys
are available in the JSON, the second one will be used for authorising the
document write, but the first `roles` key is used for subsequent authorisation
for the newly created user. By design, users can not assign themselves roles.
The vulnerability allows non-admin users to give themselves admin privileges.

We addressed this issue by updating the way CouchDB parses JSON in Erlang,
mimicking the JavaScript behaviour of picking the last key, if duplicates exist.
