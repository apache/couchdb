====================================================
CVE-2017-12636: Apache CouchDB Remote Code Execution
====================================================

:Date: 14.11.2017

:Affected: All Versions of Apache CouchDB

:Severity: Critical

:Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Description
===========

CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via HTTP(S). Some
of the configuration options include paths for operating system-level binaries
that are subsequently launched by CouchDB. This allows a CouchDB admin user to
execute arbitrary shell commands as the CouchDB user, including downloading
and executing scripts from the public internet.

Mitigation
==========

All users should upgrade to CouchDB :ref:`1.7.1 <release/1.7.1>` or
:ref:`2.1.1 <release/2.1.1>`.

Upgrades from previous 1.x and 2.x versions in the same series should be
seamless.

Users on earlier versions, or users upgrading from 1.x to 2.x should consult
with upgrade notes.
