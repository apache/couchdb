CVE-2010-3854: Apache CouchDB Cross Site Scripting Issue
========================================================

:Date: 28.01.2011

:Affected: Apache CouchDB 0.8.0 to 1.0.1

:Severity: Important

:Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Description
===========

Apache CouchDB versions prior to version :ref:`1.0.2 <release/1.0.2>` are
vulnerable to `Cross Site Scripting`_ (XSS) attacks.

.. _Cross Site Scripting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting

Mitigation
==========

All users should upgrade to CouchDB :ref:`1.0.2 <release/1.0.2>`.

Upgrades from the :ref:`0.11.x <release/0.11.x>` and
:ref:`0.10.x <release/0.10.x>` series should be seamless.

Users on earlier versions should consult with upgrade notes.

Example
=======

Due to inadequate validation of request parameters and cookie data in Futon,
CouchDB's web-based administration UI, a malicious site can execute arbitrary
code in the context of a user's browsing session.

Credit
======

This XSS issue was discovered by a source that wishes to stay anonymous.
