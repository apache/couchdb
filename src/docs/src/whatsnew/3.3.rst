Version 3.3.3
=============

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

* :ghissue:`4623`: Handle replicator instance start time during upgrades
  better.

* :ghissue:`4653`: Fix the ability to use ``;`` in config values.

* :ghissue:`4626`: Fix purge infos replicating to the wrong shards during shard
  splitting.

* :ghissue:`4669`: Make it possible to override ``[replicator]
  valid_socket_options`` with more than two items.

* :ghissue:`4670`: Allow setting of some ibrowse replication options such as
  ``{prefer_ipv6, true}``.

* :ghissue:`4679`: Fix multipart parser "attachment longer than expected"
  error. Previously there was a small chance attachments were not replicated.

* :ghissue:`4680`: Allow restarting failed shard splitting jobs.

* :ghissue:`4722`: Fix badmatch error when purge requests time out.

* :ghissue:`4736`: Stop client process and clean up if client disconnects when
  processing streaming requests.

* :ghissue:`4758`: Remove sensitive headers from the mochiweb request in
  process dictionary. This should prevent sensitive headers leaking into logs
  when a request process crashes.

* :ghissue:`4784`: Extract the correct node name from ``ERL_FLAGS`` in
  ``remsh``.

* :ghissue:`4794`: Fix incorrect raising of ``database_does_not_exist`` error.

* :ghissue:`4821`: Wait for compacted indexes to flip. Previously, a timeout
  during compact file flips could lead to crashes and a subsequent
  recompaction.

* :ghissue:`4837`: Fix update bug in ets_lru.

* :ghissue:`4847`: Require auth for ``_replicate`` endpoint.

* :ghissue:`4878`: Add an option to scrub some sensitive headers from external
  json requests.

.. _release/3.3.2:

Version 3.3.2
=============

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

* :ghissue:`4529`: In Javascript process manager, use a database tag in
  addition to a ddoc ID to quickly find processes. This should improve
  performance.

* :ghissue:`4509`, :ghissue:`4405`: Make remsh work with quoted cookie values.

* :ghissue:`4473`: Avoid re-compiling filter view functions. This could speed
  up Javascript filter functions.

* :ghissue:`4412`: Remove Javascript json2 script and the try/except clause
  around seal.

* :ghissue:`4513`: Allow configurable timeouts for ``_view`` and ``_search``.
  Search timeouts can be specified as ``[fabric] search_timeout`` and
  ``[fabric] search_permsg``. View per-message timeout can be configured as
  ``[fabric] view_permsg_timeout``.

* :ghissue:`4438`: Proxy auth can now use one of the configured hash algorithms
  from chttpd_auth/hash_algorithms to decode authentication tokens.

* :ghissue:`4370`: Ensure design docs are uploaded individually when
  replicating with ``_bulk_get``. This restores previous behavior before
  version 3.3.0.

* :ghissue:`4416`: Allow ``_local`` doc writes to the replicator dbs.
  Previously this issue prevented replicating the replicator db itself, since
  checkpointing was not working properly.

* :ghissue:`4363`: Fix replication ``_scheduler/docs`` ``"total_rows"`` value.

* :ghissue:`4380`: Be more defensive about SpiderMonkey location. An error
  should be emitted early if the Spidermonkey library cannot be found.

* :ghissue:`4388`: Bump recon to 2.5.3. See the `changelog
  <https://ferd.github.io/recon/changelog.html#2-5-3>`_ for more details.

* :ghissue:`4476`, :ghissue:`4515`, :ghissue:`4490`, :ghissue:`4350`,
  :ghissue:`4379`: Various documentation cleanups and fixes.

* Fix for `CVE-2023-26268 <https://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/cve/2023-26268.html>`_.

.. _release/3.3.1:

Version 3.3.1
=============

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

* :ghissue:`4343`, :ghissue:`4344`, :ghissue:`4345`: Fix ``undef`` when
  parsing replication doc body with a ``user_ctx``.
* :ghissue:`4346`: Add ``make`` target to find ``undef`` errors.
* :ghissue:`4347`: Remove failed ``couch_plugins`` experiment, fixes more
  ``undef`` errors.
* :ghissue:`4348`: Fix ``undef`` error in ``weatherreport``.
* :ghissue:`4353`: Allow starting of more than one replication job. (D’OH!)

.. _release/3.3.0:

Version 3.3.0
=============

Highlights
----------

* :ghissue:`4308`: Replicator was optimized and should be faster. It now uses
  the `_bulk_get` endpoint on the source, and can statistically skip calling
  `_revs_diff` on the target. Benchmark tests replicating 1M documents, 10KB
  each, from UK to US East show a 3x speed improvement.

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

* :ghissue:`3766`, :ghissue:`3970`, :ghissue:`3972`, :ghissue:`4093`,
  :ghissue:`4102`, :ghissue:`4104`, :ghissue:`4110`, :ghissue:`4111`,
  :ghissue:`4114`, :ghissue:`4245`, :ghissue:`4246`:, :ghissue:`4266`: Add
  ``smoosh`` queue persistence. This allows resuming ``smoosh`` operations
  after a node restart. This is disabled by default and can be enabled with
  ``[smoosh] persist = true``. Optimise ``smoosh`` operations and increase
  test coverage to 90%.

* :ghissue:`3798`: Add ``libicu`` version and collation algorithm version to
  ``/_node/{node-name}/_versions``.

* :ghissue:`3837`: The Erlang source tree is now auto-formatted with ``erlfmt``.

* :ghissue:`3845`: Clean up the ``couch_ejson_compare`` C-module and squash
  Microsoft compiler warnings.

* :ghissue:`3832`: Add ``GET`` variant to ``_dbs_info`` endpoint, used to be
  ``POST`` only.

* :ghissue:`3864`: Improve ``erlang_ls`` configuration.

* :ghissue:`3853`: Remove legacy ``ddoc_cache_opener`` ``gen_server`` and
  speed up event routing.

* :ghissue:`3879`: Remove use of ``ERL_OPTS`` environment variable. All
  supported Erlang versions now use ``ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS`` for the same
  purpose.

* :ghissue:`3883`: Add support for SpiderMonkey 91.

* :ghissue:`3889`: Track ``libicu`` collator versions in the view header.

* :ghissue:`3952`: Make the timeout for receiving requests from attachment
  writers configurable.

* :ghissue:`3927`: Include index signature in ``_search_info``.

* :ghissue:`3963`: Optimtize key tree stemming by using maps instead of
  sets. This greatly reduced memory usage for heavily conflicted docs in some
  situations.

* :ghissue:`3974`: Create new config options in ``[couchdb]`` and ``[smoosh]``
  sections to enable finer control of compaction logging levels.

* :ghissue:`3983`, :ghissue:`3984`, :ghissue:`3985`, :ghissue:`3987`,
  :ghissue:`4033`: Add various functions to ``couch_debug`` module.

* :ghissue:`4000`: Ensure ``Object.prototype.toSource()`` is always available.

* :ghissue:`4018`: Update ``jiffy`` to 1.1.1 and ``b64url`` to 1.0.3.

* :ghissue:`4021`: Reduce smoosh compaction log level to ``debug``.

* :ghissue:`4041`: Allow and evaluate nested json claim roles in JWT token.

* :ghissue:`4060`, :ghissue:`4290`: Add support for Erlang 25.

* :ghissue:`4064`: Enable replicating purge requests between nodes. Also avoid
  applying interactive purges more than once.

* :ghissue:`4069`, :ghissue:`4084`: Drop support for Erlang < 23, update
  ``vm.args`` settings to match. Review this if you have customized your
  ``vm.args``.

* :ghissue:`4083`: Support Elixir 13.

* :ghissue:`4085`: Add an option to let ``custodian`` always use ``[cluster] n``
  value.

* :ghissue:`4095`: Implement ``winning_revs_only`` option for the replicator. It
  replicates only the winning revisions from the source to the target,
  effectively discarding conflicts.

* :ghissue:`4135`: Separate search IO from file IO.

* :ghissue:`4140`, :ghissue:`4162`: Upgrade hash algorithm for cookie auth (sha1
  -> sha256). This introduces a new config setting ``hash_algorithms``. New cookie
  values are hashed with sha256, sha1 hashes are still accepted. Admins can set
  this to sha256 only. Sha1 will be disallowed in the next major release. Show
  supported hash algorithms in ``/_node/{node-name}/_versions`` endpoint.

* :ghissue:`4179`: Don't double-encode changes sequence strings in the
  replicator.

* :ghissue:`4182`: Explicitly maintain a fully connected cluster. Previously, it
  was possible for the nodes to disconnect, and for that state to persist until
  the nodes restarted.

* :ghissue:`4198`: Redact passwords in log file.

* :ghissue:`4243`: Update ``mochiweb`` to 3.1.1.

* :ghissue:`4254`: The ``_dbs_info`` access control is now configured with the
  ``[couchdb] admin_only_all_dbs`` setting. Defaults to true. This was a
  leftover from the 3.0.0 release.

* :ghissue:`4264`: ``active`` database sizes is now limited to leaf nodes.
  Previously, it included intermediate tree nodes, which had the effect that
  deleting (large) documents did not decrease ``active`` database size. In
  addition, ``smoosh`` now picks up databases where large documents are
  deleted for compaction more eagerly, reclaiming the deleted space quicker.

* :ghissue:`4270`: Shard splitting now uses its own ``reshard`` IO priority.
  It can be configured to be safely run in the background with production
  loads, or with maximum IO available, if admins prefer quicker progress.

* :ghissue:`4274`: Improve validation of replicator job parameters & move
  ``_replicator`` VDU design doc to internal BDU.

* :ghissue:`4280`: Add ``CFLAGS`` and ``LDFLAGS`` to ICU build parameters.

* :ghissue:`4284`: Remove all usage of global to avoid potential deadlocks
  in replication jobs.

* :ghissue:`4287`: Allow ``=`` in config key names.

* :ghissue:`4306`: Fauxton was updated to version v1.2.9. Changes since v1.2.8
  can be found `here
  <https://github.com/apache/couchdb-fauxton/releases/tag/v1.2.9>`_

* :ghissue:`4317`: Write "Relax" welcome message to standard out on
  Windows.

Performance
-----------

* :ghissue:`3860`: Add sharding to ``couch_index_server``, similar to
  :ghissue:`3366`, avoids processing bottlenecks on servers with a lot of
  concurrent view indexing going on.

* :ghissue:`3891`: Avoid decoding JWT payloads when not necessary.

* :ghissue:`4031`: Default ``[rexi] use_kill_all`` to ``true``. This improves
  intra-cluster-node messaging. Set to false if you run a cluster with nodes
  that have a version <3.0.0.

* :ghissue:`4052`: Optimise ``couch_util:reorder_results/2,3``, which speeds up
  ``_bulk_docs`` and ``_revs_diff``.

* :ghissue:`4055`: Avoid using ``length/1`` guard for ``>0`` or ``==0`` tests in
  ``couch_key_tree``.

* :ghissue:`4056`: Optimise ``couch_key_tree:find_missing/2``. This speeds up
  ``_revs_diff``.

* :ghissue:`4059`: Reduce complexity of ``possible_ancestors`` from quadratic to
  linear. This speeds up working with heavily conflicted documents
  significantly.

* :ghissue:`4091`: Optimise ``couch_util:to_hex/1``, this speeds up all
  operations that need to encode a revision id into JSON (this is most
  operations).

* :ghissue:`4106`: Set ``io_priority`` in all IO paths. Introduces ``system``
  ``io_priority``.

* :ghissue:`4144`, :ghissue:`4172`: Implement ``_bulk_get`` support for the
  replicator. Backward compatibility is ensured. This speeds up all
  replications. Add option to disable new behaviour for legacy setups.

* :ghissue:`4163`: Statistically skip ``_revs_diff`` in the replicator. This
  improves performance for replications into empty targets.

* :ghissue:`4177`: Remove the long deprecated ``bigcouch 0.4`` change sequence
  support.

* :ghissue:`4238`: Optimise ``_bulk_get`` endpoint. This speeds up replication
  of 1M docs by ~2x. Individual ``_bulk_get`` requests are up to 8x faster.

* :ghissue:`3517`: Add experimental fix for reduce performance regression due
  to expensive repeated AST-transformations on newer SpiderMonkey versions.
  Set ``COUCHDB_QUERY_SERVER_JAVASCRIPT`` env var to
  ``COUCHDB_QUERY_SERVER_JAVASCRIPT="/opt/couchdb/bin/couchjs
  /opt/couchdb/share/server/main-ast-bypass.js"``.

* :ghissue:`4262`: ``couchjs`` executable built against Spidermonkey >= 78 will
  return the detailed ``major.minor.patch`` as opposed to just the ``major``
  version as previously.
