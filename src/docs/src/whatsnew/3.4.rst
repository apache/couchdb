.. _release/3.4.1:

Version 3.4.1
=============

Highlights
----------

* :ghissue:`5255`: Set ``upgrade_hash_on_auth`` to ``false`` to disable
  automatic password hashing upgrades.

.. _release/3.4.0:

Version 3.4.0
=============

Warning
-------

CouchDB version 3.4.0 includes a feature to automatically upgrade password
hashes to a newer algorithm and a configuration option that enables this feature
by default. As a consequence, if you are upgrading to CouchDB version 3.4.0 from
an earlier version and then have to roll back to the earlier version, some of
your ``_users`` documents might have already automatically ugpraded to the new
algorithm. Your older version of CouchDB does not understand the resulting
password hash and cannot authenticate the user any more until the earlier
password hash is restored manually by an adminstrator.

As a result, the CouchDB team has decided to issue a 3.4.1 release setting the
configuration option to disable this new auto-upgrade feature.

The issue was found after the formal 3.4.0 release process has concluded, so
the source release is available normally, but the CouchDB team has not made
3.4.0 convenience binaries available. The team recommends to upgrade to 3.4.1
instead when it is available.

The CouchDB team also recommends enabling the feature by setting the
``upgrade_hash_on_auth`` configuration option to ``true`` as soon as you are
safely running on 3.4.1 and have no more need to roll back the version.

Breaking Changes
----------------

* :ghissue:`5046`: JWT: require valid ``exp`` claim by default

  Users of JWT rightly expect tokens to be considered invalid once they expire. It
  is a surprise to some that this requires a change to the default
  configuration. In the interest of security we will now require a valid ``exp``
  claim in tokens. Administrators can disable the check by changing
  ``required_claims`` back to the empty string.

  We recommend adding ``nbf`` as a required claim if you know your tokens will
  include it.

* :ghissue:`5203`: Continuous change feeds with ``descending=true&limit=N``

  Changes requests with ``feed=continuous&descending=true&limit=N``, when ``N``
  is greater than the number of db updates, will no longer wait on db changes
  and then repeatedly re-send the first few update sequences. The request will
  return immediately after all the existing update sequences are streamed back
  to the client.

* :ghissue:`4291`: Introducing Nouveau (beta) a modern, from-the-ground-up
  implementation of Lucene-based full-text search for CouchDB. Please test
  this thoroughly and report back any issues you might find.

  - :ref:`Setup instructions <nouveauconfig>`
  - :ref:`Usage <ddoc/nouveau>`
  - `Report a bug`_

.. _Report a bug: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/new/choose

* :ghissue:`4627`: Add `QuickJS`_ as a JavaScript engine option.

.. _QuickJS: https://bellard.org/quickjs/

  Advantages over SpiderMonkey:

  - Significantly smaller and easier to integrate codebase. We're using ~6
    C files vs 700+ SM91 C++ files.
  - Built with Apache CouchDB as opposed having to maintain a separate
    SpiderMonkey package for OSs that donâ€™t support it
    (\*cough*RedHat9\*cough\*).
  - Better sandboxing support.
  - Preliminary test results show multiple performance improvements.

      - 4x faster than SpiderMonkey 1.8.5.
      - 5x faster than SpiderMonkey 91.
      - 6x reduced memory usage per ``couchjs`` process (5MB vs 30MB).

  - Allows compiling JavaScript bytecode ahead of time.
  - QuickJS can be built alongside SpiderMonkey and toggled on/off at runtime::

          ./configure --dev --js-engine=quickjs

  - This makes it the default engine. But SpiderMonkey can still be set in the
    config option::

          [couchdb]
          js_engine = spidermonkey | quickjs

  - CouchDB also now includes a scanner plugin that, when enabled, can scan all
    design docs in all your databases in the background and report
    incompatibilities between SpiderMonkey and QuickJS. This allows you to
    safely migrate to QuickJS.

* :ghissue:`4570`, :ghissue:`4578`, :ghissue:`4576`: Adopt xxHash in favour
  of md5 for ``couch_file`` checksums and ETag calculation. 30% performance
  increase for large (128K) docs. No difference for smaller docs.

* :ghissue:`4814`: Introduce PBKDF2-SHA256 for password hashing. The existing
  PBKDF2-SHA1 variant is now deprecated. Increases the default iteration count
  to ``600000``. Also introduce a password hash in-memory cache with a low
  iteration number, to keep interactive requests fast for a fixed time.

  Entries in the password hash cache are time-limited, unused entries are
  automatically deleted, and there is a capacity bound.

  Existing hashed user doc entries will be automatically upgraded
  during the next successful authentication. To disable auto-upgrading
  set the ``[chttpd_auth] upgrade_hash_on_auth`` config setting to
  ``false``.

* :ghissue:`4512`: Mango: add keys-only covering indexes. Improves query
  response times for certain queries up to 10x at p(95).

* :ghissue:`4681`: Introduce optional countermeasures as we run out of
  disk space.

* :ghissue:`4847`: Require auth for ``_replicate`` endpoint. This continues
  the 3.x closed-by-default design goal.

* :ghissue:`5032`: Temporarily block access by client IP for repeated
  authentication failures. Can be disabled in config.

* Many small performance improvements, see :ref:`the Performance
  section <performance340>`.
