Version 3.1.2
=============

This is a security release for a *low severity* vulnerability. Details of
the issue will be published one week after this release. See the `CVE
database <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38295>`_
for details at a later time.

.. _release/3.1.1:

Version 3.1.1
=============

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

.. rst-class:: open

* :ghissue:`3102`, :ghissue:`1600`, :ghissue:`2877`, :ghissue:`2041`: When a
  client disconnects unexpectedly, CouchDB will no longer log a "``normal :
  unknown``" error. Bring forth the rainbows.

  :alt: The Gravity Falls gnome pukes some rainbows for us.

* :ghissue:`3109`: Drilldown parameters for text index searches may now be
  specified as a list of lists, to avoid having to define this redundantly
  in a single query. (Some languages don't have this facility.)

* :ghissue:`3132`: The new ``[chttpd] buffer_response`` option can be enabled
  to delay the start of a response until the end has been calculated. This
  increases memory usage, but simplifies client error handling as it
  eliminates the possibility that a response may be deliberately
  terminated midway through, due to a timeout. This config value may be
  changed at runtime, without impacting any in-flight responses.

Performance
-----------

Bugfixes
--------

* :ghissue:`2935`: The replicator now correctly picks jobs to restart during
  rescheduling, where previously with high load it may have failed to try to
  restart crashed jobs.

* :ghissue:`2981`: When handling extremely large documents (â‰¥50MB), CouchDB
  can no longer time out on a ``gen_server:call`` if bypassing the IOQ.

* :ghissue:`2941`: CouchDB will no longer fail to compact databases if it
  finds files from a 2.x compaction process (prior to an upgrade) on disk.

* :ghissue:`2955` CouchDB now sends the correct CSP header to ensure
  Fauxton operates correctly with newer browsers.

* :ghissue:`3061`, :ghissue:`3080`: The `couch_index` server won't crash
  and log errors if a design document is deleted while that index is
  building, or when a ddoc is added immediately after database creation.

* :ghissue:`3078`: CouchDB now checks for and complains correctly about
  invalid parameters on database creation.

* :ghissue:`3090`: CouchDB now correctly encodes URLs correctly when
  encoding the ``atts_since`` query string.

* :ghissue:`2953`: Some parameters not allowed for text-index queries on
  partitioned database are now properly validated and rejected.

* :ghissue:`3118`: Text-based search indexes may now be cleaned up
  correctly, even if the design document is now invalid.

* :ghissue:`3121`: ``fips`` is now only reported in the welcome message
  if FIPS mode was enabled at boot (such as in ``vm.args``).

* :ghissue:`3128`: Using :method:`COPY` to copy a document will no longer
  return a JSON result with two ``ok`` fields.

* :ghissue:`3138`: Malformed URLs in replication requests or documents
  will no longer throw an error.

Other
-----

* JS tests skip faster now.

* More JS tests ported into elixir: ``reader_acl``, ``reduce_builtin``,
  ``reduce_false``, ``rev_stemming``, ``update_documents``,
  ``view_collation_raw``, ``view_compaction``, all the
  ``view_multi_key`` tests, ``view_sandboxing``,
  ``view_update_seq``.

.. _release/3.1.0:

Version 3.1.0
=============

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

.. rst-class:: open

* :ghissue:`2648`: Authentication via :ref:`JSON Web Token (JWT) <api/auth/jwt>`. Full
  documentation is at the friendly link.

* :ghissue:`2770`: CouchDB now supports linking against SpiderMonkey 68, the current
  Mozilla SpiderMonkey ESR release. This provides direct support for packaging on the
  latest operating system variants, including Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa."

* A new Fauxton release is included, with updated dependencies, and a new optional
   CouchDB news page.

Performance
-----------

.. rst-class:: open

* :ghissue:`2754`: Optimized compactor performance, resulting in a 40% speed improvement
  when document revisions approach the ``revs_limit``. The fixes also include additional
  metrics on size tracking during the sort and copy phases, accessible via the
  :get:`/_active_tasks` endpoint.

* A big bowl of candy! OK, no, not really. If you got this far...thank you for reading.
