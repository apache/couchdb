.. _release/3.2.2:

Version 3.2.2
=============

Bugfixes
---------

* Fix for `CVE-2022-24706 <https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/cve/2022-24706.html>`_.
  This is a security release for a *critical* vulnerability.

* :ghissue:`3963`: Optimize compaction and doc updates for conflicted
  documents on Erlang versions higher than 21.

* :ghissue:`3852`: Add support for SpiderMonkey 91esr.

.. _release/3.2.1:

Version 3.2.1
=============

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

* :ghissue:`3746`: ``couch_icu_driver`` collation driver has been
  removed. ICU collation functionality is consolidated in the single
  ``couch_ejson_compare`` module. View performance might slightly
  increase as there are less corner cases when the C collation driver
  fails and falls back to Erlang.

* :ghissue:`3787`: Update sequences generated from DB info and
  ``_changes?since=now&limit=0`` now contain shard uuids as part of
  their internal, opaque, representation. As a result, there should be
  less chance of experiencing changes feed rewinds with these
  sequences.

* :ghissue:`3798`: ICU driver and collator algorithm versions are
  returned in the ``_node/$node/_versions`` result.

* :ghissue:`3801`: Users with the ``_metrics`` role can now read
  ``_prometheus`` metrics.

Bugfixes
--------

* :ghissue:`3780`: Avoid changes feed rewinds after shard moves.

* :ghissue:`3779`, :ghissue:`3785`: Prevent deleted view file cleanup
  from crashing when database is deleted while the cleanup process is
  running.

* :ghissue:`3789`: Fix ``badarith`` 500 errors when ``[fabric]
  request_timeout`` is set to ``infinity``.

* :ghissue:`3786`: Fix off-by-one ``limit`` error for
  ``_all_dbs``. Also, the auto-injected shard ``_dbs`` design doc is
  removed and replaced with an Erlang module.

* :ghissue:`3788`: Minimize changes feeds rewinds when a node is down.

* :ghissue:`3807`: Enable ``custodian`` application
  reporting. Previously, ``custodian`` was accidentally left disabled
  as it used a hard-coded shards db name different than ``_dbs``.

* :ghissue:`3805`: Cluster setup correctly syncs admin passwords and
  uses the new (since 3.2.0) ``[chttpd_auth]`` config section instead
  of the previous ``[couch_httpd_auth]`` section.

* :ghissue:`3810`: Local development ``dev/run`` script now uses the
  ``[chttpd_auth]`` section in ``local.ini`` instead of
  ``[couch_httpd_auth]``.

* :ghissue:`3773`: Fix reduce view collation results for unicode
  equivalent keys.

.. _release/3.2.0:

Version 3.2.0
=============

Features and Enhancements
-------------------------

* :ghissue:`3364`: CouchDB's replicator now implements a Fair Share replication
  scheduler. Rather than using a round-robin scheduling mechanism, this update allows
  specifying the relative priority of jobs via different ``_replicator`` databases.
  More information is available in the :ref:`_replicator DB docs <replicator>`.

.. figure:: ../../images/fair-enough.png
  :align: center
  :alt: Robert Downey, Jr., thinks that's fair enough for him.

* :ghissue:`3166`: Allow custom JWT claims for roles, via the ``[jwt_auth]
  roles_claim_name`` config setting.

* :ghissue:`3296`, :ghissue:`3312`: CouchDB now includes ``weatherreport`` and its
  dependency ``custodian``, a diagnostic app forked from Basho's ``riaknostic`` tool.
  More documentation is available in the :ref:`Cluster Troubleshooting
  <cluster/troubleshooting>` section.

* :ghissue:`2911`, :ghissue:`3298`, :ghissue:`3425`: CouchDB now returns the version of
  SpiderMonkey to administrators in the ``GET /_node/{node-name}/_versions`` response.

* :ghissue:`3303`: CouchDB now treats a ``408`` response received by the replicator
  similar to any ``5xx`` error (by retrying, as opposed to a permanent error). CouchDB
  will never return a ``408``, but some reverse proxies in front of CouchDB may return
  this code.

* :ghissue:`3322`: ``_session`` now accepts gzip encoding.

* :ghissue:`3254`: The new ``$keyMapMatch`` operator allows Mango to query on the keys
  of a map. It is similar to the ``$elemMatch`` operator, but instead of operating on
  the elements of array, it operates on the keys of a map.

* :ghissue:`3336`: Developers now have access to a ``.devcontainer`` configuration for
  the 3.x version of CouchDB, right in the source code repository.

* :ghissue:`3347`: The default maximum attachment size has been reduced from
  ``infinity`` to 1 GiB.

* :ghissue:`3361`: Compaction process suspension now appears in the ``active_tasks``
  output, allowing administrators to verify that the ``strict_window`` value is being
  respected.

* :ghissue:`3378`: The ``[admins]`` section and the ``[replicator] password`` are now
  redacted from all logs. In addition, :ghissue:`3380` removes user credentials,
  user documents and design documents from logfiles as much as possible. Further,
  :ghissue:`3489` no longer logs all of the messages received by a terminated internal
  Erlang process.

* :ghissue:`3421`, :ghissue:`3500`: CouchDB now supports SpiderMonkey 78 and 86.

* :ghissue:`3422`: CouchDB now supports Erlang/OTP 23 and ``error_logger`` reports
  for Erlang/OTP >= 21.

* :ghissue:`3566`: CouchDB now also supports Erlang/OTP 24.

* :ghissue:`3571`: CouchDB *no longer supports Erlang/OTP 19*.

* :ghissue:`3643`: Contribute a custom Erlang network protocol to CouchDB,
  users can specify nodes to use TCP or TLS.

.. figure:: ../../images/TLS-Handshake.png
  :align: center
  :alt: The SSL/TLS handshake enables the TLS client and server to establish
        the secret keys with which they communicate.

* :ghissue:`3472`, :ghissue:`3473`, :ghissue:`3609`: Migrate some config options from
  ``[httpd]`` to ``[chttpd]``, migrate some from ``[couch_httpd_auth]`` to
  ``[chttpd_auth]``, and comment all out in the ``default.ini``.

  * Config options moved from ``[httpd]`` to ``[chttpd]``:
    ``allow_jsonp``, ``changes_timeout``, ``config_whitelist``,
    ``enable_cors``, ``secure_rewrites``, ``x_forwarded_host``,
    ``x_forwarded_proto``, ``x_forwarded_ssl``,
    ``enable_xframe_options``, ``max_http_request_size``.

  * Config options moved from ``[couch_httpd_auth]`` to ``[chttpd_auth]``:
    ``authentication_redirect``, ``timeout``, ``auth_cache_size``,
    ``allow_persistent_cookies``, ``iterations``, ``min_iterations``, ``max_iterations``,
    ``password_scheme``, ``proxy_use_secret``, ``public_fields``, ``secret``,
    ``users_db_public``, ``x_auth_roles``, ``x_auth_token``, ``x_auth_username``,
    ``cookie_domain``, ``same_site``

* :ghissue:`3586`: We added a new way of specifying basic auth credentials
  which can include various characters previously not allowed to be included
  in the url info part of endpoint urls.

* :ghissue:`3483`: We added a way of specifying requirements for new user passwords
  using a list of regular expressions.

* :ghissue:`3506`, :ghissue:`3416`, :ghissue:`3377`: CouchDB now provides a Prometheus
  compatible endpoint at ``GET /_node/{node-name}/_prometheus``. A configuration option
  allows for scraping via a different port (17986) that does not require authentication,
  if desired. More information is available at the :ref:`Prometheus API endpoint
  <api/server/prometheus>` summary.

* :ghissue:`3697`, :issue:`883` (JIRA): As an opt-in policy, CouchDB can now stop
  encoding the plus sign ``+`` in non-query parts of URLs, in compliance with the
  original CouchDB standards. The opt-in is via the ``[chttpd] decode_plus_to_space =
  true`` setting. *In CouchDB 4.x, this is going to be an opt-out policy.*

* :ghissue:`3724`: CouchDB now has new CSP settings for attachments and show/list
  functions. This deprecates the old ``[csp] enable`` and ``[csp] header_value``
  settings, replacing them with the new ``[csp] utils_enable`` and ``[csp]
  utils_header_value`` settings respectively. In addition, new settings for
  ``attachments_enable``, ``attachments_header_value``, ``showlist_enable`` and
  ``showlist_header_value`` now are available. Documentation is in the ``default.ini``
  file.

* :ghissue:`3734`, :ghissue:`3733`: Users with databases that have low ``q`` and ``n``
  values would often receive the ``No DB shards could be opened`` error when the cluster
  is overloaded, due to a hard-coded 100ms timeout. CouchDB now calculates a more
  reasonable timeout, based on the number of shards and the overall maximum fabric
  request timeout limit, using a geometric series.

Performance
-----------

* :ghissue:`3337`: Developer nodes now start faster when using the ``dev/run`` script.

* :ghissue:`3366`: The monolithic ``couch_server`` process has been sharded for
  performance. Previously, as a single ``gen_server``, the process would
  have a finite throughput that, in busy clusters, is easily breached -- causing a
  sizeable backlog in the message queue, ultimately leading to failure and errors. No
  more! The aggregate message queue info is still available in the ``_system`` output.
  ( :ghissue:`3370` )

* :ghissue:`3208`: CouchDB now uses the latest ibrowse 4.4.2 client for the replicator.

* :ghissue:`3600`, :ghissue:`3047`, :ghissue:`3019`: The default ``slack`` channel for
  smoosh auto-compaction has been increased to a more reasonable value, reducing load
  on systems that would have normally been idle in CouchDB 2.x (where no auto-compaction
  daemon exists).

* :ghissue:`3711`: Changes feeds may no longer rewind after shard moves, assuming the
  node and range specified by the changes feed nonce can still match an existing node's
  shard.

Bugfixes
--------

* Complete retirement of the JavaScript test suite - replaced by Elixir. Hooray!
* :ghissue:`3165`: Allow configurability of JWT claims that require a value. Also fixes
  :ghissue:`3232`. Further, :ghissue:`3392` no longer validates claims provided that
  CouchDB does not require.
* :ghissue:`3160`, :ghissue:`3161`: The ``run_queue`` statistic now returns valid
  information even when using Erlang BEAM dirty CPU and IO queues.
* :ghissue:`3162`: Makefiles updated to include local configs & clean configs when
  running ``make devclean``.
* :ghissue:`3195`: The ``max_document_size`` parameter now has a clearer explanation in
  ``default.ini``.
* :ghissue:`3207`, :ghissue:`2536`: Improve the ``INSTALL.Unix.md`` file.
* :ghissue:`3212`: Base and extra headers are properly combined when making replicator
  requests that contain duplicate headers.
* :ghissue:`3201`: When using a POST with request body to pass parameters to a view-like
  request, the boolean parameters are accepting only JSON strings, but not booleans.
  Now, CouchDB accepts ``true`` and ``false`` for the ``stable`` parameter, in addition
  to ``"true"`` and ``"false"``.
  comment in
* :ghissue:`1988`: Attachment operations ``PUT /db/doc`` and ``POST /db`` now perform
  consistent attachment name validation.
* :ghissue:`3249`: Documents with lots of conflicts no longer blow up couchjs if the
  user calls ``_changes`` with a JS filter and with ``style=all_docs``.
* :ghissue:`3144`: Respawning compaction jobs to catch up with intervening changes are
  now handled correctly by the smoosh monitor.
* :ghissue:`3252`: CouchDB now exports the ``couch_util:json_decode/2`` function to
  support maps instead of the default data structure.
* :ghissue:`3255`, :ghissue:`2558`: View files that have incorrect ``db_headers``
  now reset the index forcing a rebuild.
* :ghissue:`3271`: Attachments that are stored uncompressed but later replicated to
  nodes that compress the attachment no longer fail an internal md5 check that would
  break eventual consistency between nodes.
* :ghissue:`3277`: ``req_body`` requests that have ``req_body`` set already now
  properly return the field without parsing.
* :ghissue:`3279`: Some default headers were missing from some responses in replication,
  including ``X-CouchDB-Body-Time`` and ``X-Couch-Request-ID``.
* :ghissue:`3329`, :ghissue:`2962`: CouchDB no longer returns broken couchjs processes
  to the internal viewserver process pool.
* :ghissue:`3340`, :ghissue:`1943`: ``PUTs`` of ``multipart/related`` attachments now
  support a ``Transfer-Encoding`` value of ``chunked``. Hooray!
* :ghissue:`2858`, :ghissue:`3359`: The cluster setup wizard no longer fails when a
  request to ``/`` is not made before a request to ``finish_cluster``.
* :ghissue:`3368`: Changing the ``max_dbs_open`` configuration setting correctly
  ensures that each new ``couch_server_X`` property receives ``1/num_servers()`` of it.
* :ghissue:`3373`: Requests to ``{db}/_changes`` with a custom filter no longer result
  in a fabric request timeout if the request body is not available to additional cluster
  nodes, resulting in a more descriptive exit message and proper JSON object validation
  in the payload.
* :ghissue:`3409`: The internal ``chttpd_external:json_req_obj/2`` function now reads
  the cached ``peer`` before falling back to a socket read operation.
* :ghissue:`3335`, :ghissue:`3617`, :ghissue:`3708`: The ``COUCHDB_FAUXTON_DOCROOT``
  environment variable is now introduced to allow its explicit overriding at startup.
* :ghissue:`3471`: http clients should no longer receive stacktraces unexpectedly.
* :ghissue:`3491`: libicu tests no longer fail on older OS releases such as CentOS 6
  and 7.
* :ghissue:`3541`: Usernames and passwords can now contain `@` and not break the
  CouchDB replicator.
* :ghissue:`3545`: The ``dreyfus_index_manager`` process now supports offheap message
  queues.
* :ghissue:`3551`: The replication worker pool now properly cleans up worker processes
  as they are done via the ``worker_trap_exits = false`` setting.
* :ghissue:`3633`, :ghissue:`3631`: All code paths for creating databases now fully
  respect db creation options, including partitioning options.
* :ghissue:`3424`, :ghissue:`3362`: When using ``latest=true`` and an old revision with
  conflicting children as rev is specified, CouchDB no longer returns an ``"error":
  "case_clause"`` response.
* :ghissue:`3673`: Non-existent attachments now return a ``404`` when the attachment
  is missing.
* :ghissue:`3698`: The ``dev/run`` development script now allows clusters where ``n >
  5``.
* :ghissue:`3700`: The ``maybe_close`` message is now sent to the correct internal
  process.
* :ghissue:`3183`: The smoosh operator guide now recommends to use the ``rpc:multicall``
  function.
* :ghissue:`3712`: Including a payload within a ``DELETE`` operation no longer hangs
  the next request made to the same mochiweb acceptor.
* :ghissue:`3715`: For clusters with databases where ``n > [cluster] n``, attachments
  chunks are longer dropped on quorum writes.
* :ghissue:`3507`: If a file is truncated underneath CouchDB, CouchDB will now log
  the filename if it finds this situation with a ``file_truncate_error``.
* :ghissue:`3739`: Shards with large purge sequences no longer fail to split in a
  shard splitting job.
* :ghissue:`3754`: Always return views meta info when ``limit=0`` and
  ``sorted=true``.
* :ghissue:`3757`: Properly sort ``descending=true`` view results with a ``keys``
  list.
* :ghissue:`3763`: Stabilize view row sorting order when they are merged by the
  coordinator.
