    Before a server admin is configured, all clients have admin privileges.
    This is fine when HTTP access is restricted 
    to trusted users. <strong>If end-users will be accessing this CouchDB, you must
      create an admin account to prevent accidental (or malicious) data loss.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="help-block">Server admins can create and destroy databases, install 
    and update _design documents, run the test suite, and edit all aspects of CouchDB 
    configuration.
    </p>
    <p class="help-block">Non-admin users have read and write access to all databases, which
    are controlled by validation functions. CouchDB can be configured to block all
    access to anonymous users.
