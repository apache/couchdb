.. _api/db/purge:

``/db/_purge``
==============

.. http:post:: /{db}/_purge

  A database purge permanently removes the references to deleted documents
  from the database. Normal deletion of a document within CouchDB does not
  remove the document from the database, instead, the document is marked as
  ``_deleted=true`` (and a new revision is created). This is to ensure that
  deleted documents can be replicated to other databases as having been
  deleted. This also means that you can check the status of a document and
  identify that the document has been deleted by its absence.

  .. warning::

     Purging a document from a database should only be done as a last resort
     when sensitive information has been introduced inadvertently into a
     database. In clustered or replicated environments it is very difficult
     to guarantee that a particular purged document has been removed from all
     replicas. Do not rely on this API as a way of doing secure deletion.

  The purge operation removes the references to the deleted documents from
  the database. The purging of old documents is not replicated to other
  databases. If you are replicating between databases and have deleted a
  large number of documents you should run purge on each database.

  .. note::

     Purging documents does not remove the space used by them on disk. To
     reclaim disk space, you should run a database compact (see
     :ref:`api/db/compact`), and compact views (see :ref:`api/db/compact/ddoc`).

  The format of the request must include the document ID and one or more
  revisions that must be purged.

  The response will contain the purge sequence number, and a list of the
  document IDs and revisions successfully purged.

Updating Indexes
----------------

The number of purges on a database is tracked using a purge sequence.
This is used by the view indexer to optimize the updating of views that
contain the purged documents.

When the indexer identifies that the purge sequence on a database has
changed, it compares the purge sequence of the database with that stored
in the view index. If the difference between the stored sequence and
database is sequence is only 1, then the indexer uses a cached list of
the most recently purged documents, and then removes these documents
from the index individually. This prevents completely rebuilding the
index from scratch.

If the difference between the stored sequence number and current
database sequence is greater than 1, then the view index is entirely
rebuilt. This is an expensive operation as every document in the
database must be examined.


.. _api/db/missing_revs:

``/db/_missing_revs``

.. _api/db/revs_diff:

``/db/_revs_diff``
==================

.. http:post:: /{db}/_revs_diff

  Given a set of document/revision IDs, returns the subset of those that do
  not correspond to revisions stored in the database.

  Its primary use is by the replicator, as an important optimization: after
  receiving a set of new revision IDs from the source database, the replicator
  sends this set to the destination database's ``_revs_diff`` to find out which
  of them already exist there. It can then avoid fetching and sending
  already-known document bodies.

  Both the request and response bodies are JSON objects whose keys are document
  IDs; but the values are structured differently:

  - In the request, a value is an array of revision IDs for that document.

  - In the response, a value is an object with a ``missing``: key, whose value
    is a list of revision IDs for that document (the ones that are not stored
    in the database) and optionally a ``possible_ancestors`` key, whose value is
    an array of revision IDs that are known that might be ancestors of
    the missing revisions.
