Databases
=========

The Database endpoint provides an interface to an entire database with in
CouchDB. These are database-level, rather than document-level requests.

For all these requests, the database name within the URL path
should be the database name that you wish to perform the operation on.
For example, to obtain the meta information for the database
``recipes``, you would use the HTTP request:

.. code-block:: http

    GET /recipes

For clarity, the form below is used in the URL paths:

.. code-block:: http

    GET /db

Where ``db`` is the name of any database.
