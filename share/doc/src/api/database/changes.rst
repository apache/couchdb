.. _api/db/changes:

================
``/db/_changes``
================

.. http:get:: /{db}/_changes

  Returns a sorted list of changes made to documents in the database, in time
  order of application, can be obtained from the database's ``_changes``
  resource. Only the most recent change for a given document is guaranteed to
  be provided, for example if a document has had fields added, and then deleted,
  an API client checking for changes will not necessarily receive the
  intermediate state of added documents.

  This can be used to listen for update and modifications to the database for
  post processing or synchronization, and for practical purposes, a continuously
  connected ``_changes`` feed is a reasonable approach for generating a
  real-time log for most applications.

  :param db: Database name
  :<header Accept: - :mimetype:`application/json`
                   - :mimetype:`text/event-stream`
                   - :mimetype:`text/plain`
  :<header Last-Event-ID: ID of the last events received by the server on a
    previous connection. Overrides `since` query parameter.
  :query array doc_ids: List of document IDs to filter the changes feed as
   valid JSON array. Used with :ref:`_doc_ids <changes/filter/doc_ids>` filter.
   Since `length of URL is limited`_, it is better to use
   :post:`/{db}/_changes` instead.
  :query boolean conflicts: Includes `conflicts` information in response.
    Ignored if `include_docs` isn't ``true``. Default is ``false``.
  :query boolean descending: Return the change results in descending sequence
    order (most recent change first). Default is ``false``.
  :query string feed: see :ref:`changes`. Default is ``normal``.
  :query string filter: Reference to a :ref:`filter function <filterfun>`
    from a design document that will filter whole stream emitting only filtered
    events. See the `section in the book`_ for more information.
  :query number heartbeat: Period in *milliseconds* after which an empty line is
    sent in the results. Only applicable for :ref:`longpoll <changes/longpoll>`
    or :ref:`continuous <changes/continuous>` feeds. Overrides any timeout to
    keep the feed alive indefinitely. Default is ``60000``. May be ``true`` to
    use default value.
  :query boolean include_docs: Include the associated document with each result.
    If there are conflicts, only the winning revision is returned.
    Default is ``false``.
  :query number last-event-id: Alias of `Last-Event-ID` header.
  :query number limit: Limit number of result rows to the specified value
    (note that using ``0`` here has the same effect as ``1``).
  :query since: Start the results from the change immediately after the given
    sequence number. Can be integer number or ``now`` value. Default is ``0``.
  :query string style: Specifies how many revisions are returned in the changes
    array. The default, ``main_only``, will only return the current "winning"
    revision; ``all_docs`` will return all leaf revisions (including conflicts
    and deleted former conflicts).
  :query number timeout: Maximum period in *milliseconds* to wait for a change
    before the response is sent, even if there are no results. Only applicable
    for :ref:`longpoll <changes/longpoll>` or :ref:`continuous
    <changes/continuous>` feeds. Default value is specified by
    :config:option:`httpd/changes_timeout` configuration option.
    Note that ``60000`` value is also the default maximum timeout to prevent
    undetected dead connections.
  :query string view: Allows to use view functions as filters. Documents
    counted as "passed" for view filter in case if map function emits at least
    one record for them. See :ref:`changes/filter/view` for more info.
  :>header Cache-Control: ``no-cache`` if changes feed is
    :ref:`eventsource <changes/eventsource>`

.. _changes:

Changes Feeds
=============

.. _changes/normal:

Polling
-------

By default all changes are immediately returned within the JSON body::

    GET /somedatabase/_changes HTTP/1.1

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"results":[
    {"seq":1,"id":"fresh","changes":[{"rev":"1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d"}]},
    {"seq":3,"id":"updated","changes":[{"rev":"2-7051cbe5c8faecd085a3fa619e6e6337"}]},
    {"seq":5,"id":"deleted","changes":[{"rev":"2-eec205a9d413992850a6e32678485900"}],"deleted":true}
    ],
    "last_seq":5}

``results`` is the list of changes in sequential order. New and changed
documents only differ in the value of the rev; deleted documents include the
``"deleted": true`` attribute. (In the ``style=all_docs mode``, deleted applies
only to the current/winning revision. The other revisions listed might be
deleted even if there is no deleted property; you have to ``GET`` them
individually to make sure.)

``last_seq`` is the sequence number of the last update returned. (Currently it
will always be the same as the seq of the last item in results.)

Sending a ``since`` param in the query string skips all changes up to and
including the given sequence number::

    GET /somedatabase/_changes?since=3 HTTP/1.1


The return structure for ``normal`` and ``longpoll`` modes is a JSON
array of changes objects, and the last update sequence number.

In the return format for ``continuous`` mode, the server sends a ``CRLF``
(carriage-return, linefeed) delimited line for each change. Each line
contains the `JSON object` described above.

You can also request the full contents of each document change (instead
of just the change notification) by using the ``include_docs`` parameter.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "last_seq": 5
        "results": [
            {
                "changes": [
                    {
                        "rev": "2-eec205a9d413992850a6e32678485900"
                    }
                ],
                "deleted": true,
                "id": "deleted",
                "seq": 5,
            }
        ]
    }

.. _changes/longpoll:

Long Polling
------------

The `longpoll` feed, probably most applicable for a browser, is a more
efficient form of polling that waits for a change to occur before the response
is sent. `longpoll` avoids the need to frequently poll CouchDB to discover
nothing has changed!

The request to the server will remain open until a change is made on the
database and is subsequently transferred, and then the connection will close.
This is low load for both server and client.

The response is basically the same JSON as is sent for the `normal` feed.

Because the wait for a change can be significant you can set a
timeout before the connection is automatically closed (the
``timeout`` argument). You can also set a heartbeat interval (using
the ``heartbeat`` query argument), which sends a newline to keep the
connection active.


.. _changes/continuous:

Continuous
----------

Continually polling the CouchDB server is not ideal - setting up new HTTP
connections just to tell the client that nothing happened puts unnecessary
strain on CouchDB.

A continuous feed stays open and connected to the database until explicitly
closed and changes are sent to the client as they happen, i.e. in near
real-time.

As with the `longpoll` feed type you can set both the timeout and heartbeat
intervals to ensure that the connection is kept open for new changes
and updates.

The continuous feed's response is a little different than the other feed types
to simplify the job of the client - each line of the response is either empty
or a JSON object representing a single change, as found in the normal feed's
results.

.. code-block:: text

    GET /somedatabase/_changes?feed=continuous HTTP/1.1

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"seq":1,"id":"fresh","changes":[{"rev":"1-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d"}]}
    {"seq":3,"id":"updated","changes":[{"rev":"2-7051cbe5c8faecd085a3fa619e6e6337"}]}
    {"seq":5,"id":"deleted","changes":[{"rev":"2-eec205a9d413992850a6e32678485900"}],"deleted":true}
    ... tum tee tum ...
    {"seq":6,"id":"updated","changes":[{"rev":"3-825cb35de44c433bfb2df415563a19de"}]}

Obviously, `... tum tee tum ...` does not appear in the actual response, but
represents a long pause before the change with seq 6 occurred.  

.. _section in the book: http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/notifications.html

.. _changes/eventsource:

Event Source
------------

The `eventsource` feed provides push notifications that can be consumed in
the form of DOM events in the browser. Refer to the `W3C eventsource
specification`_ for further details. CouchDB also honours the ``Last-Event-ID``
parameter.

.. code-block:: text

    GET /somedatabase/_changes?feed=eventsource HTTP/1.1

.. code-block:: javascript

    // define the event handling function
    if (window.EventSource) {

      var source = new EventSource("/somedatabase/_changes?feed=eventsource");
      source.onerror = function(e) {
        alert('EventSource failed.');
      };

      var results = [];
      var sourceListener = function(e) {
        var data = JSON.parse(e.data);
        results.push(data);
      };

      // start listening for events
      source.addEventListener('message', sourceListener, false);

      // stop listening for events
      source.removeEventListener('message', sourceListener, false);

    }

.. note::

   EventSource connections are subject to cross-origin resource sharing
   restrictions. You might need to configure :ref:`CORS support
   <cors>` to get the EventSource to work in your application.

.. _W3C eventsource specification: http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/


.. _changes/filter:

Filtering
=========

You can filter the contents of the changes feed in a number of ways. The
most basic way is to specify one or more document IDs to the query. This
causes the returned structure value to only contain changes for the
specified IDs. Note that the value of this query argument should be a
JSON formatted array.

You can also filter the ``_changes`` feed by defining a filter function
within a design document. The specification for the filter is the same
as for replication filters. You specify the name of the filter function
to the ``filter`` parameter, specifying the design document name and
:ref:`filter name <filterfun>`. For example:

.. code-block:: http

    GET /db/_changes?filter=design_doc/filtername

Additionally, there are couple of builtin filters are available and described
below.


.. _changes/filter/doc_ids:

_doc_ids
--------

This filter accepts only changes for documents which ID in specified in
``doc_ids`` query parameter or payload's object array. See
:post:`/{db}/_changes` for an example.


.. _changes/filter/design:

_design
-------

The ``_design`` filter accepts only changes for any design document within the
requested database.

**Request**:

.. code-block:: http

  GET /recipes/_changes?filter=_design HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json
  Host: localhost:5984

          }
      ]
  }


.. _changes/filter/view:

_view
-----

.. versionadded:: 1.2

The special filter ``_view`` allows to use existed :ref:`map function <mapfun>`
as the :ref:`filter <filterfun>`. If the map function emits anything for the
processed document he counts as accepted and the changes event emits to the
feed. For most use-practice cases `filter` functions are very similar to `map`
ones, so this feature helps to reduce amount of duplicated code.

.. warning::

   While :ref:`map functions <mapfun>` doesn't process the design documents,
   using ``_view`` filter forces them to do this. You need to be sure, that
   they are ready to handle documents with *alien* structure without panic
   crush.

.. note::

   Using ``_view`` filter doesn't queries the view index files, so you cannot
   use common :ref:`view query parameters <api/ddoc/view>` to additionally
   filter the changes feed by index key. Also, CouchDB doesn't returns
   the result instantly as he does for views - it really uses the specified
   map function as filter.

   Moreover, you cannot make such filters dynamic e.g. process the request
   query parameters or handle the :ref:`userctx_object` - the map function is
   only operates with the document.

  GET /recipes/_changes?filter=_view&view=ingredients/by_recipe HTTP/1.1
