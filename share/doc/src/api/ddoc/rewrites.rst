``/db/_design/design-doc/_rewrite/path``
========================================

.. http:any:: /{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_rewrite/{path}

  Rewrites the specified path by rules defined in the specified design document.

  The rewrite rules are defined in *array* field of the design document called
  ``rewrites``. Each rule is an *object* with next structure:

  - **from** (*string*): The path rule used to bind current uri to the rule.
    It use pattern matching for that
  - **to** (*string*): Rule to rewrite an url. It can contain variables
    depending on  binding variables discovered during pattern matching and
    query args (url args and from the query member)
  - **method** (*string*): HTTP request method to bind the request method to
    the rule. Default is ``"*"``
  - **query** (*object*): Query args you want to define they can contain
    dynamic variable by binding the key

  The ``to``and ``from`` paths may contains string patterns with leading ``:``
  or ``*`` characters.

  For example: ``/somepath/:var/*``

  - This path is converted in Erlang list by splitting ``/``
  - Each ``var`` are converted in atom
  - ``""`` are converted to ``''`` atom
  - The pattern matching is done by splitting ``/`` in request url in a list of
    token
  - A string pattern will match equal token
  - The star atom (``'*'`` in single quotes) will match any number of tokens,
    but may only be present as the last `pathterm` in a `pathspec`
  - If all tokens are matched and all `pathterms` are used, then the `pathspec`
    matches

  The pattern matching is done by first matching the HTTP request method to a
  rule. ``method`` is equal to ``"*"`` by default, and will match any HTTP
  method. It will then try to match the path to one rule. If no rule matches,
  then a :statuscode:`404` response returned.

  Once a rule is found we rewrite the request url using the ``to`` and ``query``
  fields. The identified token are matched to the rule and will replace var.
  If ``'*'`` is found in the rule it will contain the remaining part if it
  exists.
  
  Examples:
  
  +--------------------------------------+----------+------------------+-------+
  |               Rule                   |    Url   |  Rewrite to      | Tokens|
  +======================================+==========+==================+=======+
  | {"from": "/a", "to": "/some"}        | /a       | /some            |       |
  +--------------------------------------+----------+------------------+-------+
  | {"from": "/a/\*", "to": "/some/\*}   | /a/b/c   | /some/b/c        |       |
  +--------------------------------------+----------+------------------+-------+
  | {"from": "/a/b", "to": "/some"}      | /a/b?k=v | /some?k=v        | k=v   |
  +--------------------------------------+----------+------------------+-------+
  | {"from": "/a/b", "to": "/some/:var"} | /a/b     | /some/b?var=b    | var=b |
  +--------------------------------------+----------+------------------+-------+
  | {"from": "/a/:foo/",                 | /a/b/c   | /some/b/c?foo=b  | foo=b |
  | "to": "/some/:foo/"}                 |          |                  |       |
  +--------------------------------------+----------+------------------+-------+
  | {"from": "/a/:foo", "to": "/some",   | /a/b     | /some/?k=b&foo=b | foo=b |
  | "query": { "k": ":foo" }}            |          |                  |       |
  +--------------------------------------+----------+------------------+-------+
  | {"from": "/a", "to": "/some/:foo"}   | /a?foo=b | /some/?b&foo=b   | foo=b |
  +--------------------------------------+----------+------------------+-------+

  Request method, header, query parameters, request payload and response body
  are depended on endpoint to which url will be rewrited.
