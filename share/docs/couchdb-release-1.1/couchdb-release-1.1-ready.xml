    <title>Upgrading to CouchDB 1.1</title>

    <para>
      You can upgrade your existing CouchDB 1.0.x installation to
      CouchDB 1.1 without any specific steps or migration. When you run
      CouchDB 1.1 the existing data and index files will be opened and
      used as normal.
    </para>

    <para>
      The first time you run a compaction routine on your database
      within CouchDB 1.1, the data structure and indexes will be updated
      to the new version of the CouchDB database format that can only be
      read by CouchDB 1.1 and later. This step is not reversable. Once
      the data files have been updated and migrated to the new version
      the data files will no longer work with a CouchDB 1.0.x release.
    </para>

    <warning>
      <para>
        If you want to retain support for openein gthe data files in
        CouchDB 1.0.x you must back up your data files before performing
        the upgrade and compaction process.

    <title>Replicator Database</title>

    <para>
      A database where you

      <para>
        In the couch log you'll see 2 entries like these:

          <para>
            A Unix timestamp (number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970) that
            tells us when the current replication state (marked in
            <literal>_replication_state</literal>) was set.
          </para>
        </listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        When the replication finishes, it will update the
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field (and
        <literal>_replication_state_time</literal>) with the value
        <literal>completed</literal>, so the document will look like:

      <para>
        When an error happens during replication, the
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field is set to
        <literal>error</literal> (and
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> gets updated of course).
      </para>

      <para>
        When you PUT/POST a document to the
        <literal>_replicator</literal> database, CouchDB will attempt to
        start the replication up to 10 times (configurable under
        <literal>[replicator]</literal>, parameter
        <literal>max_replication_retry_count</literal>). If it fails on
        the first attempt, it waits 5 seconds before doing a second
        attempt. If the second attempt fails, it waits 10 seconds before
        doing a third attempt. If the third attempt fails, it waits 20
        seconds before doing a fourth attempt (each attempt doubles the
        previous wait period). When an attempt fails, the Couch log will
        show you something like:
      </para>

<programlisting>[error] [&lt;0.149.0&gt;] Error starting replication `67c1bb92010e7abe35d7d629635f18b6+create_target` (document `my_rep_2`): {db_not_found,&lt;&lt;"could not open http://myserver:5986/foo/"&gt;&gt;</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>
          The <literal>_replication_state</literal> field is only set to
          <literal>error</literal> when all the attempts were
          unsuccessful.
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>
        There are only 3 possible values for the
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field:
        <literal>triggered</literal>, <literal>completed</literal> and
        <literal>error</literal>. Continuous replications never get
        their state set to <literal>completed</literal>.
      </para>

    </section>

    <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-replicatordb-docsame">

      <title>Documents describing the same replication</title>

      <para>
        Lets suppose 2 documents are added to the
        <literal>_replicator</literal> database in the following order:
      </para>

<programlisting>{
    "_id": "doc_A",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "bar"
}</programlisting>

      <para>
        and
      </para>

<programlisting>{
    "_id": "doc_B",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "bar"
}</programlisting>

      <para>
        Both describe exactly the same replication (only their
        <literal>_ids</literal> differ). In this case document
        <literal>doc_A</literal> triggers the replication, getting
        updated by CouchDB with the fields
        <literal>_replication_state</literal>,
        <literal>_replication_state_time</literal> and
        <literal>_replication_id</literal>, just like it was described
        before. Document <literal>doc_B</literal> however, is only
        updated with one field, the <literal>_replication_id</literal>
        so it will look like this:
      </para>

<programlisting>{
    "_id": "doc_B",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "bar",
    "_replication_id":  "c0ebe9256695ff083347cbf95f93e280"
}</programlisting>

      <para>
        While document <literal>doc_A</literal> will look like this:
      </para>

<programlisting>{
    "_id": "doc_A",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "bar",
    "_replication_id":  "c0ebe9256695ff083347cbf95f93e280",
    "_replication_state":  "triggered",
    "_replication_state_time":  1297974122
}</programlisting>

      <para>
        Note that both document get exactly the same value for the
        <literal>_replication_id</literal> field. This way you can
        identify which documents refer to the same replication - you can
        for example define a view which maps replication IDs to document
        IDs.
      </para>

    <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-replicatordb-cancel">

      <title>Canceling replications</title>

      <para>
        To cancel a replication simply <literal>DELETE</literal> the
        document which triggered the replication. The Couch log will
        show you an entry like the following:
      </para>

<programlisting>[Thu, 17 Feb 2011 20:16:29 GMT] [info] [&lt;0.125.0&gt;] Stopped replication `c0ebe9256695ff083347cbf95f93e280+continuous+create_target` because replication document `doc_A` was deleted</programlisting>

      <note>
        <para>
          You need to <literal>DELETE</literal> the document that
          triggered the replication. <literal>DELETE</literal>ing
          another document that describes the same replication but did
          not trigger it, will not cancel the replication.
        </para>
      </note>

    </section>

    <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-replicatordb-restart">

      <title>Server restart</title>

      <para>
        When CouchDB is restarted, it checks its
        <literal>_replicator</literal> database and restarts any
        replication that is described by a document that either has its
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field set to
        <literal>triggered</literal> or it doesn't have yet the
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field set.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          Continuous replications always have a
          <literal>_replication_state</literal> field with the value
          <literal>triggered</literal>, therefore they're always
          restarted when CouchDB is restarted.

      <title>Changing the Replicator Database</title>

      <para>
        Imagine your replicator database (default name is _replicator)
        has the two following documents that represent pull replications
        from servers A and B:

      <para>
        Now without stopping and restarting CouchDB, you change the name

<programlisting>$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/_config/replicator/db -d '"another_replicator_db"'

      <para>
        As soon as this is done, both pull replications defined before,
        are stopped. This is explicitly mentioned in CouchDB's log:

      <para>
        From now own you have a single replication going on in your
        system: a pull replication pulling from server X. Now you change
        back the replicator database to the original one

      <para>
        Immediately after this operation, the replication pulling from

        _replicator database (pulling from servers A and B) will be
        resumed.
      </para>

      <para>
        Changing again the replicator database to

    <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-replicatordb-delegations">

      <title>Delegations</title>

      <para>
        Replication documents can have a custom
        <literal>user_ctx</literal> property. This property defines the
        user context under which a replication runs. For the old way of
        triggering replications (POSTing to
        <literal>/_replicate/</literal>), this property was not needed
        (it didn't exist in fact) - this is because at the moment of
        triggering the replication it has information about the
        authenticated user. With the replicator database, since it's a
        regular database, the information about the authenticated user
        is only present at the moment the replication document is
        written to the database - the replicator database implementation
        is like a _changes feed consumer (with
        <literal>?include_docs=true</literal>) that reacts to what was
        written to the replicator database - in fact this feature could
        be implemented with an external script/program. This
        implementation detail implies that for non admin users, a
        <literal>user_ctx</literal> property, containing the user's name
        and a subset of his/her roles, must be defined in the
        replication document. This is ensured by the document update
        validation function present in the default design document of
        the replicator database. This validation function also ensure
        that a non admin user can set a user name property in the
        <literal>user_ctx</literal> property that doesn't match his/her
        own name (same principle applies for the roles).
      </para>

      <para>
        For admins, the <literal>user_ctx</literal> property is
        optional, and if it's missing it defaults to a user context with
        name null and an empty list of roles - this mean design
        documents will not be written to local targets. If writing
        design documents to local targets is desired, the a user context
        with the roles <literal>_admin</literal> must be set explicitly.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also, for admins the <literal>user_ctx</literal> property can be
        used to trigger a replication on behalf of another user. This is
        the user context that will be passed to local target database
        document validation functions.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          The <literal>user_ctx</literal> property only has effect for
          local endpoints.
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>
        Example delegated replication document:
      </para>

<programlisting>{
     "_id": "my_rep",
     "source":  "http://bserver.com:5984/foo",
     "target":  "bar",

     "user_ctx": {
          "name": "joe",
          "roles": ["erlanger", "researcher"]
     }
}</programlisting>

      <para>
        As stated before, for admins the user_ctx property is optional,
        while for regular (non admin) users it's mandatory. When the
        roles property of <literal>user_ctx</literal> is missing, it
        defaults to the empty list <literal>[ ]</literal>.

    <title>Native SSL Support</title>

    <para>
      CouchDB 1.1 supports SSL natively. All your secure connection
      needs can now be served without the need set and maintain a
      separate proxy server that handles SSL.
    </para>

    <para>
      SSL setup can be tricky, but the configuration in CouchDB was
      designed to be as easy as possible. All you need is two files; a
      certificate and a private key. If you bought an official SSL
      certificate from a certificate authority, both should be in your
      possession already.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you just want to try this out and don't want to pay anything
      upfront, you can create a self-signed certificate. Everything will
      work the same, but clients will get a warning about an insecure
      certificate.
    </para>

    <para>
      Now start (or restart) CouchDB. You should be able to connect to

    </para>

<programlisting>shell&gt; <userinput>curl https://127.0.0.1:6984/</userinput>
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
using the --cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
not match the domain name in the URL).
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
the -k (or --insecure) option.</programlisting>

    <para>
      Oh no what happened?! — Remember, clients will notify their
      users that your certificate is self signed.
      <command>curl</command> is the client in this case and it notifies
      you. Luckily you trust yourself (don't you?) and you can specify
      the <option>-k</option> option as the message reads:
    </para>

<programlisting>shell&gt; <userinput>curl -k https://127.0.0.1:6984/</userinput>
{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"1.1.0"}</programlisting>

    <para>
      All done.

  <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-httprange">

    <title>HTTP Range Requests</title>

    <para>
      HTTP allows you to specify byte ranges for requests. This allows
      the implementation of resumable downloads and skippable audio and
      video streams alike. Now this is available for all attachments
      inside CouchDB.
    </para>

    <para>
      This is just a real quick run through how this looks under the
      hood. Usually, you will have larger binary files to serve from
      CouchDB, like MP3s and videos, but to make things a little more
      obvious, I use a text file here (Note that I use the
      <literal>application/octet-stream</literal> Content-Type instead
      of <literal>text/plain</literal>).
    </para>

<programlisting>shell&gt; <userinput>cat file.txt </userinput>
My hovercraft is full of eels!</programlisting>

    <para>
      Now lets store this text file as an attachment in CouchDB. First,
      we create a database:
    </para>

<programlisting>shell&gt; <userinput>curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/test</userinput>
{"ok":true}</programlisting>

    <para>
      Then we create a new document and the file attachment in one go:
    </para>

<programlisting>shell&gt; <userinput>curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/test/doc/file.txt -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" -d@file.txt</userinput>
{"ok":true,"id":"doc","rev":"1-287a28fa680ae0c7fb4729bf0c6e0cf2"}</programlisting>

    <para>
      Now we can request the whole file easily:
    </para>

<programlisting>shell&gt; <userinput>curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/test/doc/file.txt</userinput>
My hovercraft is full of eels!</programlisting>

    <para>
      But say we only want the first 13 bytes:
    </para>

<programlisting>shell&gt; <userinput>curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/test/doc/file.txt -H "Range: bytes=0-12"</userinput>
My hovercraft</programlisting>

    <para>
      HTTP supports many ways to specify single and even multiple byte
      rangers. Read all about it in
      <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.27">RFC
      2616</ulink>.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Databases that have been created with CouchDB 1.0.2 or earlier
        will support range requests in 1.1.0, but they are using a
        less-optimal algorithm. If you plan to make heavy use of this
        feature, make sure to compact your database with CouchDB 1.1.0
        to take advantage of a better algorithm to find byte ranges.
      </para>

  <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-proxying">

    <title>HTTP Proxying</title>

    <para>
      The HTTP proxy feature makes it easy to map and redirect different
      content through your CouchDB URL. The proxy works by mapping a
      pathname and passing all content after that prefix through to the
      configured proxy address.
    </para>

    <para>
      Configuration of the proxy redirect is handled through the
      <literal>[httpd_global_handlers]</literal> section of the CouchDB
      configuration file (typically <filename>local.ini</filename>). The
      format is:
    </para>

<programlisting>[httpd_global_handlers]
PREFIX = {couch_httpd_proxy, handle_proxy_req, &lt;&lt;"DESTINATION"&gt;&gt;}</programlisting>

    <para>
      Where:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>PREFIX</literal>
        </para>

        <para>
          Is the string that will be matched. The string can be any
          valid qualifier, although to ensure that existing database
          names are not overridden by a proxy configuration, you can use
          an underscore prefix.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>DESTINATION</literal>
        </para>

        <para>
          The fully-qualified URL to which the request should be sent.
          The destination must include the <literal>http</literal>
          prefix. The content is used verbatim in the original request,
          so you can also forward to servers on different ports and to
          specific paths on the target host.
        </para>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      The proxy process then translates requests of the form:
    </para>

<programlisting>http://couchdb:5984/PREFIX/path</programlisting>

    <para>
      To:
    </para>

<programlisting>DESTINATION/path</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>
        Everything after <literal>PREFIX</literal> including the
        required forward slash will be appended to the
        <literal>DESTINATION</literal>.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      The response is then communicated back to the original client.
    </para>

    <para>
      For example, the following configuration:
    </para>

<programlisting>_google = {couch_httpd_proxy, handle_proxy_req, &lt;&lt;"http://www.google.com"&gt;&gt;}</programlisting>

    <para>
      Would forward all requests for
      <literal>http://couchdb:5984/_google</literal> to the Google
      website.
    </para>

    <para>
      The service can also be used to forward to related CouchDB
      services, such as Lucene:
    </para>

<programlisting>[httpd_global_handlers]
_fti = {couch_httpd_proxy, handle_proxy_req, &lt;&lt;"http://127.0.0.1:5985"&gt;&gt;}</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>
        The proxy service is basic. If the request is not identified by
        the <literal>DESTINATION</literal>, or the remainder of the
        <literal>PATH</literal> specification is incomplete, the
        original request URL is interpreted as if the
        <literal>PREFIX</literal> component of that URL does not exist.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, requesting
        <literal>http://couchdb:5984/_intranet/media</literal> when
        <filename>/media</filename> on the proxy destination does not
        exist, will cause the request URL to be interpreted as
        <literal>http://couchdb:5984/media</literal>. Care should be
        taken to ensure that both requested URLs and destination URLs
        are able to cope
      </para>

  <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-commonjs">

    <title>Added CommonJS support to map functions</title>

    <para>
      We didn't have CommonJS require in map functions because the
      current CommonJS implementation is scoped to the whole design doc,
      and giving views access to load code from anywhere in the design
      doc would mean we'd have to blow away your view index any time you
      changed anything. Having to rebuild views from scratch just
      because you changed some CSS or a show function isn't fun, so we
      avoided the issue by keeping CommonJS require out of map and
      reduce altogether.
    </para>

    <para>
      The solution we came up with is to allow CommonJS inside map and
      reduce funs, but only of libraries that are stored inside the
      views part of the design doc.
    </para>

    <para>
      So you could continue to access CommonJS code in design_doc.foo,
      from your list functions etc, but we'd add the ability to require
      CommonJS modules within map and reduce, but only from
      design_doc.views.lib
    </para>

    <para>
      There's no worry here about namespace collisions, as Couch just
      plucks <literal>views.*.map</literal> and
      <literal>views.*.reduce</literal> out of the design doc. So you
      could have a view called <literal>lib</literal> if you wanted, and
      still have CommonJS stored in <literal>views.lib.sha1</literal>
      and <literal>views.lib.stemmer</literal> if you wanted.
    </para>

    <para>
      We simplified the implementation by enforcing that CommonJS
      modules to be used in map functions be stored in views.lib.
    </para>

    <para>
      A sample design doc (taken from the test suite in Futon) is below:
    </para>

<programlisting>{
   "views" : {
      "lib" : {
         "baz" : "exports.baz = 'bam';",
         "foo" : {
            "zoom" : "exports.zoom = 'yeah';",
            "boom" : "exports.boom = 'ok';",
            "foo" : "exports.foo = 'bar';"
         }
      },
      "commonjs" : {
         "map" : "function(doc) { emit(null, require('views/lib/foo/boom').boom)}"
      }
   },
   "_id" : "_design/test"
}</programlisting>

    <para>
      The <literal>require()</literal> statement is relative to the
      design document, but anything loaded form outside of
      <literal>views/lib</literal> will fail.
    </para>

  </section>

  <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-etag">

    <title>More granular ETag support for views</title>

    <para>
      ETags have been assigned to a map/reduce group (the collection of
      views in a single design document). Any change to any of the
      indexes for those views would generate a new ETag for all view
      URL's in a single design doc, even if that specific view's results
      had not changed.
    </para>

    <para>
      In CouchDB 1.1 each <literal>_view</literal> URL has it's own ETag
      which only gets updated when changes are made to the database that
      effect that index. If the index for that specific view does not
      change, that view keeps the original ETag head (therefore sending
      back 304 Not Modified more often).

    <para>
      The <literal>_changes</literal> feed can now be used to watch
      changes to specific document ID's or the list of
      <literal>_design</literal> documents in a database. If the
      <literal>filters</literal> parameter is set to
      <literal>_doc_ids</literal> a list of doc IDs can be passed in the

  <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-wildcards">

    <title>Allow wildcards in vhosts definitions</title>

    <para>
      Similar to the rewrites section of a <literal>_design</literal>
      document, the new <literal>vhosts</literal> system uses variables
      in the form of :varname or wildcards in the form of asterisks. The
      variable results can be output into the resulting path as they are
      in the rewriter.
    </para>

  <section id="couchdb-release-1.1-osprocess">

    <title>OS Daemons</title>

    <para>
      CouchDB now supports starting external processes. The support is
      simple and enables CouchDB to start each configured OS daemon. If
      the daemon stops at any point, CouchDB will restart it (with
      protection to ensure regularly failing daemons are not repeatedly
      restarted).
    </para>

    <para>
      The daemon starting process is one-to-one; for each each
      configured daemon in the configuration file, CouchDB will start
      exactly one instance. If you need to run multiple instances, then
      you must create separate individual configurations. Daemons are
      configured within the <literal>[os_daemons]</literal> section of
      your configuration file (<filename>local.ini</filename>). The
      format of each configured daemon is:
    </para>

<programlisting>NAME = PATH ARGS</programlisting>

    <para>
      Where <literal>NAME</literal> is an arbitrary (and unique) name to
      identify the daemon; <literal>PATH</literal> is the full path to
      the daemon to be executed; <literal>ARGS</literal> are any
      required arguments to the daemon.
    </para>

    <para>
      For example:
    </para>

<programlisting>[os_daemons]
basic_responder = /usr/local/bin/responsder.js</programlisting>

    <para>
      There is no interactivity between CouchDB and the running process,
      but you can use the OS Daemons service to create new HTTP servers
      and responders and then use the new proxy service to redirect
      requests and output to the CouchDB managed service. For more
      information on proxying, see
      <xref linkend="couchdb-release-1.1-proxying"/>. For further

  <section id="coudhdb-release-1.1-updateafter">

    <title>Stale views and <literal>update_after</literal></title>

    <para>
      Currently a view request can include the

      contents of a stale view index to be used to produce the view
      output. In order to trigger a build of the outdated view index, a

    </para>

    <para>
      To simplify this process, the <literal>update_after</literal>
