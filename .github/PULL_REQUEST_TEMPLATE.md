<!-- Thank you for your contribution!

     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments
     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.

     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model
     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers
     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed
     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a
     CouchDB committer.
