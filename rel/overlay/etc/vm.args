# Each node in the system must have a unique name. These are specified through
# the Erlang -name flag, which takes the form:
#
#    -name nodename@<FQDN>
#
# or
#
#    -name nodename@<IP-ADDRESS>
#
# CouchDB recommends the following values for this flag:
#
# 1. If this is a single node, not in a cluster, use:
#    -name couchdb@127.0.0.1
#
# 2. If DNS is configured for this host, use the FQDN, such as:
#    -name couchdb@my.host.domain.com
#
# 3. If DNS isn't configured for this host, use IP addresses only, such as:
#    -name couchdb@192.168.0.1
#
# Do not rely on tricks with /etc/hosts or libresolv to handle anything
# other than the above 3 approaches correctly. They will not work reliably.
#
# Multiple CouchDBs running on the same machine can use couchdb1@, couchdb2@,
# etc.
