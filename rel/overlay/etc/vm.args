# Each node in the system must have a unique name. These are specified through
# the Erlang -name flag, which takes the form:
#
#    -name nodename@<FQDN>
#
# or
#
#    -name nodename@<IP-ADDRESS>
#
# CouchDB recommends the following values for this flag:
#
# 1. If this is a single node, not in a cluster, use:
#    -name couchdb@127.0.0.1
#
# 2. If DNS is configured for this host, use the FQDN, such as:
#    -name couchdb@my.host.domain.com
#
# 3. If DNS isn't configured for this host, use IP addresses only, such as:
#    -name couchdb@192.168.0.1
#
# Do not rely on tricks with /etc/hosts or libresolv to handle anything
# other than the above 3 approaches correctly. They will not work reliably.
#
# Multiple CouchDBs running on the same machine can use couchdb1@, couchdb2@,
# etc.

# This will toggle to true in Erlang 25+. However since we don't use global
# any longer, and have our own auto-connection module, we can keep the
# existing global behavior to avoid surprises. See
# https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues/6470#issuecomment-1337421210 for more
# information about possible increased coordination and messages being sent on

# Set Erlang process limit. If not set in Erlang 27 and greater versions it
# defaults to 1048576. In Erlang versions less than 27 it defaulted to 262144.
# When a cluster reaches this limit it will emit "Too many processes" error in
# the log. That could be a time to bump it up. The actual value set will be a
# larger power of 2 number. To check the actual limit call
# `erlang:system_info(process_limit).` in remsh.

## TLS Distribution
## Use TLS for connections between Erlang cluster members.
## http://erlang.org/doc/apps/ssl/ssl_distribution.html
##
## Generate Cert(PEM) File
## This is just an example command to generate a certfile (PEM).
## This is not an endorsement of specific expiration limits, key sizes, or algorithms.
##    $ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
##    $ cat key.pem cert.pem > dev/erlserver.pem && rm key.pem cert.pem
##
## Generate a Config File (couch_ssl_dist.conf)
##    [{server,
##      [{certfile, "</path/to/erlserver.pem>"},
##       {secure_renegotiate, true}]},
##     {client,
##      [{secure_renegotiate, true}]}].
##
## CouchDB recommends the following values for no_tls flag:
## 1. Use TCP only, set to true, such as:
##      -couch_dist no_tls true
## 2. Use TLS only, set to false, such as:
##      -couch_dist no_tls false
## 3. Specify which node to use TCP, such as:
##      -couch_dist no_tls \"*@127.0.0.1\"
##
## To ensure search works, make sure to set 'no_tls' option for the clouseau node.
## By default that would be "clouseau@127.0.0.1".
## Don't forget to override the paths to point to your certificate(s) and key(s)!

# Enable FIPS mode
#   https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/crypto/fips.html
#   Ensure that:
#    - Erlang is built with --enable-fips configuration option
#    - Crypto library (e.g. OpenSSL) supports this mode
#
# When the mode is successfully enabled "Welcome" message should show `fips`
# in the features list.
