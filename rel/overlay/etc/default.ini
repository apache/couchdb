;   hmac:_default = aGVsbG8=
;   hmac:foo = aGVsbG8=
; The config values can represent symmetric and asymmetrics keys.
; For symmetrics keys, the value is base64 encoded;
;   hmac:_default = aGVsbG8= # base64-encoded form of "hello"
; For asymmetric keys, the value is the PEM encoding of the public
; key with newlines replaced with the escape sequence \n.
;   rsa:foo = -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBIjAN...IDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n
;   ec:bar = -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMHYwEAYHK...AzztRs\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n
; Since version 3.3 it's possible for keys to contain "=" characters when the
; config setting is in the "key = value" format. In other words, there must be a space
; between the key and the equals sign, and another space between the equal sign
; and the value. For example, it should look like this:
